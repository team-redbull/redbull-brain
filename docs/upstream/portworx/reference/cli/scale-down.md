## Removing offline nodes​

This document describes how to remove an offline node from a cluster. If you are specifically interested in decommissioning nodes with no storage that have been offline for an extended period, see Automatic decommission of storageless nodes.

-
Identify the cluster that needs to be managed:

```

pxctl status

```

```

Status: PX is operational

Node ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3e2b01cd0bc3

    IP: X.X.X.197

-
List the nodes in the cluster:

```

pxctl cluster list

```

```

Cluster ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-0242ac110002

Status: OK

Nodes in the cluster:

```

-
List the volumes in the cluster:

```

pxctl volume list

```

```

845707146523643463	testvol	1 GiB	1	no	no		LOW	up - attached on X.X.X.197

```

In this case, there is one volume in the cluster and it is attached to node with IP X.X.X.97

-
Identify the node that you want to remove from the cluster.

In the following example, node X.X.X.197 has been marked as offline:

```

pxctl cluster list

```

```

Cluster ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-0242ac110002

Nodes in the cluster:

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3e2b01cd0bc3	X.X.X.197	-		-	N/A		1.1.2-c27cf42	Offline

```

-
Attach and detach the volume in one of the surviving nodes:

```

pxctl host attach 845707146523643463

```

```

Volume successfully attached at: /dev/pxd/pxd845707146523643463

```

```

pxctl host detach 845707146523643463

```

```

Volume successfully detached

```

-
Delete the local volume that belonged to the offline node:

```

pxctl volume delete 845707146523643463

```

```

Volume 845707146523643463 successfully deleted.

```

-
Delete the node that is offline:

```

pxctl cluster delete xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3e2b01cd0bc3

```

```

Node xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3e2b01cd0bc3 successfully deleted.

```

-
List the nodes in the cluster to make sure that the node is removed:

```

pxctl cluster list

```

```

## Removing a functional node from a cluster​

A functional Portworx node may need to be removed from the cluster. In this section, we'll demonstrate the removal of a node by running commands on the node itself as well as the removal of a node from another node.

The following output shows the state of the cluster and the different node IPs and node IDs:

```

pxctl status

```

```

### Suspend active cloudsnap operations​

-
Identify any active cloudsnap operations being run on the node that you intend to decommission:

```

pxctl cloudsnap status

```

The `STATE` of active operations shows as `Backup-Active`:

```

NAME                                    SOURCEVOLUME        STATE           NODE            TIME-ELAPSED        COMPLETED

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-278535e49860    885345022234521857  Backup-Done     10.13.90.125    39.746191264s       Tue, 22 Mar 2022 22:53:37 UTC

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3c3ccf47f276    186701534582547510  Backup-Done     10.13.90.122    1.677455484s        Tue, 22 Mar 2022 23:59:49 UTC

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-73176c2d03e2    885345022234521857  Backup-Done     10.13.90.125    27.550329395s       Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:15 UTC

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2307865c1b93    649554470078043771  Backup-Active   10.13.90.125    5m12.61653365s

```

From this output, identify the volumes with active backups. For example, if node 10.13.90.125 is being decommissioned, then the volume with active backup is `649554470078043771`.

-
Identify the namespace of the volume the cloudsnap operation is occurring on. The namespace is displayed under the `Labels` section in the output from the following command. Replace `<source_volume>` with the `SOURCEVOLUME` value for the volume that is in a `Backup-Active` state from the previous output:

```

pxctl volume inspect <source_volume>

```

```

Volume               :  649554470078043771

Name                 :  pvc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-d4827680f6de

Size                 :  500 GiB

Last Attached        :  Mar 22 20:37:58 UTC 2022

Device Path          :  /dev/pxd/pxd649554470078043771

...

```

-
Suspend backup operations for the volume and wait for current backup to complete:

```

storkctl suspend volumesnapshotschedule vdbench-pvc-sharedv4-schedule  -n vdbench

```

-
Verify the suspension. The `SUSPEND` field will show as `true`:

```

storkctl get volumesnapshotschedule -n vdbench

```

```

NAME                            PVC                    POLICYNAME   PRE-EXEC-RULE   POST-EXEC-RULE   RECLAIM-POLICY   SUSPEND   LAST-SUCCESS-TIME

vdbench-pvc-sharedv4-schedule   vdbench-pvc-sharedv4   testpolicy                                    Delete           true      22 Mar 22 17:10 PDT

```

Repeat these steps until all active snaps complete and all backup operations are suspended on the node that you want to decommission.

### Prevention of data loss​

If any node hosts a volume with replication factor of 1, then Portworx disallows decommissioning of such nodes because there is data loss.

One possible workaround to decommission such a node is to increase the replication of single replica volumes by running `volume ha-update`.

-
List all the volumes hosts on the decommissioning node:

```

pxctl volume  list --node xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2eeddcd64d51

```

```

ID                      NAME                                            SIZE    HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED  PROXY-VOLUME     IO_PRIORITY     STATUS                          SNAP-ENABLED

633738568577538909      pvc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-d4827680f6de        2 GiB   3       no      no         no               LOW             up - attached on 172.31.45.106    no

161898313715947409      pvc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-68f0d970e10c        2 GiB   1       no      no         no               LOW             up - attached on 172.31.45.106    no

```

-
Increase the replication factor:

```

pxctl volume ha-update --repl 2 161898313715947409

```

Once the volume is completely replicated onto another node, continue with the node decommissioning. This time, the volume already has another replica on another node, so decommissioning the node will reduce the replication factor of the volume and remove the node.

### Placing the node in maintenance mode​

After identifying the node to be removed (see "Identify the node that you want to remove from the cluster" above), place the node in maintenance mode.

Log in to the node to be decommissioned:

```

pxctl service maintenance --enter

```

```

This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.

Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y

Entered maintenance mode.

```

### Run the cluster delete command​

Example 1: Running the cluster delete command from a different node

`ssh` to `172.31.46.119` and run the following command:

```

pxctl cluster delete xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2eeddcd64d51

```

```

Node xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2eeddcd64d51 successfully deleted.

```

Example 2: Running the cluster delete command from the same node

`ssh` to `172.31.33.252` and type:

```

pxctl cluster delete xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-428e727eb6b8

```

```

Node xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-428e727eb6b8 successfully deleted.

```

### Clean up Portworx metadata on the node​

To learn how to remove or clean up Portworx metadata on the decommissioned node, see clean up Portworx metadata on the node.

## Automatic decommission of storageless nodes​

Storageless nodes that are initialized and added to the cluster may not be needed once they complete their tasks (such as in a scheduler workflow). If they are taken offline or destroyed, the cluster will still retain the nodes and mark them as offline.

If eventually a majority of such nodes exist, the cluster won't have a quorum of nodes that are online. The solution is to run cluster delete commands and remove such nodes. This gets more laborious with more such nodes or an increased frequency of such nodes added and taken down.

To help with this, Portworx waits until a grace period of 48 hours has passed. After this period, offline nodes with no storage will be removed from the cluster. There is no CLI command needed to turn on or trigger this feature.
