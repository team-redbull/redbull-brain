The component names specified in `spec.components.componentNames` are case sensitive. For a list of valid component names with the correct capitalization, refer to the mapping of components to workloads, pods, and containers.

## ComponentK8sConfig​

FieldDescriptionType

`apiVersion`APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
may reject unrecognized values.
More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources`string`

`kind`Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
Cannot be updated.
In CamelCase.
More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds`string`

`spec`ComponentK8sConfigSpec defines the desired state of ComponentK8sConfig`object`

`status`ComponentK8sConfigStatus defines the synchronization state of the configuration.`object`

### `spec` fields​

FieldDescriptionType

`spec.globalConfig`GlobalConfig contains settings that apply to all Portworx components. Component-specific settings in `spec.components` override global settings. You can configure labels, annotations, placement rules, and a priority class globally. You can’t configure resource requirements globally; specify them per component.

Note: Supported in Portworx Operator 25.6.0 or later.`object`

`spec.globalConfig.labels`Labels applied to all Portworx component pods.`object`

`spec.globalConfig.annotations`Annotations applied to all Portworx component pods.`object`

`spec.globalConfig.placement`Placement rules (node affinity and tolerations) applied to all Portworx component pods.`object`

`spec.globalConfig.priorityClass``PriorityClass` applied to all Portworx component pods. This helps ensure Portworx pods are scheduled with the specified priority and are less likely to be evicted under resource pressure. For more information, see Pod Priority and Preemption.`string`

`spec.components`Components is the list of Portworx components that are deployed and managed by PX Operator`array`

`spec.components.componentNames`ComponentNames for which the configurations will be applied.`array`

`spec.components.workloadConfigs`WorkloadConfig contains the configuration for the various workloads - deployments, daemonset or pods of a component.`array`

`containerConfigs.resources.claims`Claims lists the names of resources, defined in spec.resourceClaims,
that are used by this container.

This is an alpha field and requires enabling the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

This field is immutable. It can only be set for containers.`array`

`spec.components.workloadConfigs.`
`containerConfigs.resources.claims.name`Name must match the name of one entry in pod.spec.resourceClaims of
the Pod where this field is used. It makes that resource available

`containerConfigs.resources.limits`Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/`object`

`spec.components.workloadConfigs.`
`containerConfigs.resources.requests`Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required.
If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified,
otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits.

the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose
a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is
most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e.
for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource
request, requiredDuringScheduling affinity expressions, etc.),
compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding
"weight" to the sum if the node matches the corresponding matchExpressions; the
node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.`array`
