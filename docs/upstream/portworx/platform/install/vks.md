# Install Portworx on VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service

Source: https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/platform/install/vks (Portworx Enterprise latest)

Install Portworx on VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

You can install Portworx Enterprise on vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) to enable enterprise-grade cloud-native storage for your Kubernetes workloads. The installation process includes preparing the environment, generating manifests in Portworx Central, applying them to the cluster, and verifying the deployment.

note

For the underlying datastore used by PVs and VMs, do not enable the Storage DRS feature. The vSphere CSI driver and Cloud Native Storage do not support Storage DRS in vSphere. For more information, see the vSphere CSI Driver supported features matrix.

The following diagram demonstrates how Portworx operates the cloud drives:

When Portworx is deployed within VKS, the Cloud Drive (CD) module does the following:

-
Initializes a Portworx node which involves joining the VKS cluster as a storage capable node, adding to the global capacity of the cluster.

-
The CD module executes a subsequence of calls to check the following points:

- If there are a set of drives attached to the node, the CD module uses them. If they are not already attached to the node, the CD module attaches them.

- If there are no drives attached or available for that node, the CD module creates and attaches them.

-
The CSI implementation in cloud drives makes calls to Kubernetes instead of talking to the underlying storage API.

## Prerequisites​

In addition to the System Requirements, ensure that your cluster meets all prerequisites based on VMware documentation.

The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx on VKS environment:

- Create the StorageClass

- Install Portworx

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

note

Helm VKS is supported on Portworx chart version 9.1.0 and later.

## (Optional) Install packages for encrypted volumes​

If you are using encrypted volumes on VKS clusters with PhotonOS, install the `device-mapper` and `cryptsetup` packages on the cluster nodes using the following commands:

- Update the package repositories:

```

yum update -y

```

- Install the `device-mapper` packages:

```

yum install device-mapper

```

- Install the `cryptsetup` packages:

```

yum install cryptsetup

```

note

Newly added cluster nodes do not include these packages by default, which prevents encryption of volumes attached to them.

## Create the StorageClass​

In a Kubernetes environment, the Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standardized interface that enables Portworx integration with VKS clusters. VKS uses CSI to dynamically provision and manage persistent volumes for containerized applications.

To enable CSI cloud drive configuration, complete the following steps. You must create a `StorageClass` that specifies the CSI driver as the provisioner and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.

-
Retrieve the CSI provisioner name by running the following command on your VKS cluster:

```

kubectl get csidriver

```

-
Create a StorageClass on your target datastore using the following configuration.
In the `provisioner` field, enter the CSI driver name from Step 1. Use the datastore URL from your vSphere client in the `datastoreurl` field.

```

kind: StorageClass

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

metadata:

  name: vsphere-immediate-sc

  annotations:

     storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"

provisioner: <csi_driver_name>

parameters:

  datastoreurl: "<your-datastore-url>"

allowVolumeExpansion: true

reclaimPolicy: Delete

volumeBindingMode: Immediate

```

note

You can also specify the SPBM policies in the StorageClass with the `storagepolicyname` parameter.

## Install Portworx​

You can install Portworx Enterprise on a VKS cluster either by generating a Kubernetes specification through Portworx Central and applying it, or by deploying the Portworx Helm chart. Choose the installation mode that matches your tooling and operational preferences.

- Generate Specification

- Install using Helm

To install Portworx with Kubernetes, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your cluster:

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In the Portworx Enterprise section, select Generate Cluster Spec.
 The system displays the Generate Spec page.

-
From the Portworx Version dropdown menu, select the Portworx version to install.

-
For Platform, select VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS).

-
Specify the same StorageClass name that you created in the Create the StorageClass section (`vsphere-immediate-sc`).

-
(Optional) To customize the configuration options and generate a custom specification, click Customize and perform the following steps:

note

To continue without customizing the default configuration or generating a custom specification, proceed to Step 7.

-
In the Kubernetes Distribution section, under Are you running on either of these?, select the distribution.

-
In the Component Settings section:

- Select the Enable Stork checkbox to enable Stork.

- Select the Restrict Data Protection RBAC to restrict RBAC permissions for Stork (if enabled) and Operator. You will not be able to use Backup and DR capabilities with this restriction. For more information, see Restrict Data Protection RBAC.

- Select the Enable Monitoring checkbox to enable monitoring of Portworx components and resources.

- To configure the monitoring stack, select one of the following:

- Portworx Managed - To enable Portworx to install and manage Prometheus and Operator automatically.
 Ensure that no other Prometheus Operator instance already running on the cluster.

- User Managed - To configure and manage your own monitoring stack.

- Select the Enable Autopilot checkbox to enable Portworx Autopilot. For User Managed monitoring stack, Portworx supports the following metrics providers that Autopilot will use to fetch metrics for rule evaluation and automated actions.

- Prometheus - Provide a valid Prometheus URL

- Datadog - Provide a valid Datadog URL, Secret Name and Secret Namespace. To create a Secret, refer to enable Datadog.
 For more information on Autopilot, see Expanding your Storage Pool with Autopilot.

- Select the Enable Telemetry checkbox to enable telemetry in the StorageCluster spec.
For more information, see Enable Pure1 integration for upgrades on a VKS cluster.

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- Select the Secrets Store Type from the dropdown menu to store and manage secure information for features such as CloudSnaps and Encryption.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download.yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

#### Apply the specification​

Apply the generated specs to your cluster.

```

kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml

```

You can install Portworx Enterprise on VKS using the Portworx Helm chart. This procedure assumes that Portworx is installed in the `portworx` namespace. If you want to install it in a different namespace, use the `-n <px-namespace>` flag.

-
Add the `portworx/helm` repository to your local Helm repository:

```

helm repo add portworx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/helm/master/stable/

```

```

"portworx" has been added to your repositories

```

-
Verify that the repository has been successfully added:

```

helm repo list

```

```

NAME    	URL

portworx	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/helm/master/stable/

```

-
Create a `px_install_values.yaml` file that contains VKS-specific configuration. Replace placeholder values with those that match your environment:

```

VKSInstall: true

storeV2Install: true

clusterName: <unique-cluster-name>

drives: "sc=<storage-policy-name>,size=<size-in-gb>"

systemMetadataDevice: "sc=<storage-policy-name>,size=<size-in-gb>"

csi:

  enabled: true

installCertManager: true

internalKVDB: true

internalKvdbTls: true

```

The `VKSInstall: true` flag is required. It injects the following environment variables that are required for successful Portworx deployment on VKS.

```

- name: ENABLE_CSI_DRIVE

  value: "true"

- name: PRE-EXEC

  value: "iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --..."

```

-
(Optional) In many cases, you may want to customize Portworx configurations, such as enabling monitoring or specifying specific storage devices. You can pass the custom configuration to the `px_install_values.yaml` file.

note

- You can refer to the Portworx Helm chart parameters for a list of configurable parameters and the values.yaml file for the configuration file template.

- The default `clusterName` is `mycluster`. However, it is recommended to change it to a unique identifier to avoid conflicts in multi-cluster environments.

-
Install Portworx:

note

To install a specific version of the Helm chart, use the `--version` flag. Example: `helm install <px-release> portworx/portworx --version <helm-chart-version>`.

```

helm install <px-release> portworx/portworx -n portworx -f px_install_values.yaml --debug

```

-
Check the status of your Portworx installation:

```

helm status <px-release> -n portworx

```

```

NAME: px-release

LAST DEPLOYED: DATE

NAMESPACE: portworx

STATUS: deployed

REVISION: 1

TEST SUITE: None

NOTES:

Your Release is named "px-release"

Portworx Pods should be running on each node in your cluster.

Portworx would create a unified pool of the disks attached to your Kubernetes nodes.

No further action should be required and you are ready to consume Portworx Volumes as part of your application data requirements.

```

## Verify Portworx Pod Status​

Enter the following command to list and filter the results for Portworx pods and specify the namespace where you have deployed Portworx:

```

kubectl get pods -n <px-namespace> -o wide | grep -e portworx -e px

```

```
