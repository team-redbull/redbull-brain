Install Portworx on SUSE Virtualization | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

Skip to main content

Version: 3.7

You can install Portworx on a SUSE Virtualization cluster to leverage high availability, scalable storage, and automation for your Kubernetes workloads. Portworx supports standard Kubernetes deployments running on a SUSE Virtualization cluster. The process integrates Portworx with a SUSE Virtualization cluster, ensuring persistent storage for demanding applications.

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx Enterprise on a SUSE Virtualization cluster with FlashArray. It details the necessary steps for configuring multipathing, deploying the Portworx operator and StorageCluster, and updating SUSE Virtualization's storage configurations.

Portworx installation on a SUSE Virtualization cluster is managed via Kubernetes manifests, generated through Portworx Central. You can apply a Portworx Operator and StorageCluster manifest to your SUSE Virtualization cluster, which automates and orchestrates the installation across all nodes. The operator-based deployment is recommended for ease of management and updates.

## Architecture​

The following architectural diagram illustrates a Portworx Enterprise deployment on a cluster running SUSE Virtualization, integrated with FlashArray for backend storage.

Each node in the SUSE Virtualization environment runs SUSE Linux Micro and is orchestrated by RKE2. These nodes host multiple virtual machines (VMs) running various guest operating systems, such as Ubuntu and Windows. Portworx is deployed on each node to create a distributed block storage pool, which is provisioned across the cluster. The Portworx CSI Driver enables dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes and orchestrates volume lifecycle operations across nodes. A storage cluster is formed using Portworx, which interfaces with FlashArray. FlashArray provides high-performance, external block storage that is connected to all nodes through multipathing.

## Prerequisites​

In addition to the System Requirements, ensure that your SUSE Virtualization cluster meets the following requirements before installing Portworx Enterprise:

- Use FlashArray as the storage backend.

- Attach the backing storage disks to each worker node.

- Allocate a dedicated disk for KVDB (internal or external) on at least three nodes. Each disk must have a unique device name across all KVDB nodes. For more information, see KVDB for Portworx.

- Disable kernel auto-updates on your cluster.

Limitations

- Portworx does not support sharedv4 volumes on SUSE Virtualization nodes that use the SLE Micro operating system. The overlay filesystem on these nodes prevents Portworx from completing the required mount operations for sharedv4. Portworx supports only PX Raw RWX volumes for KubeVirt workloads on SUSE Virtualization.

- Synchronous disaster recovery and asynchronous disaster recovery for SUSE Virtualization is supported with Stork 26.2.0 or later and Portworx Enterprise 3.5.2 or later.

The following collection of tasks describes how to install Portworx on a SUSE Virtualization cluster:

- Configure multipathing for FlashArray

- Configure Udev rules

- Apply Multipath and Udev configurations

- Set up user access in FlashArray

- Create pure.json file

- Add FlashArray configuration to a kubernetes secret

- Generate Portworx Specification

- Deploy Portworx Operator

- Deploy StorageCluster

- Create a StorageClass

- Update the CSI Driver Configuration

- Create a VM

- Verify Portworx Installation

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Configure multipathing for FlashArray​

To ensure compatibility between Portworx Enterprise and FlashArray, configure the multipath settings on your cluster before installation.

- FlashArray and Portworx Enterprise do not support user-friendly names. Set `user_friendly_names` to `no` before installing Portworx Enterprise on your cluster. This ensures consistent device naming conventions between Portworx and FlashArray.

- Add `polling_interval 10` as recommended by RHEL Linux settings. This defines how often the system checks for path status updates.

- To avoid interference from the multipathd service during Portworx volume operations, set the pxd device denylist rule.

Your /etc/multipath.conf file must follow this structure:

```

defaults {

   user_friendly_names no

   enable_foreign "^$"

   polling_interval    10

}

devices {

   device {

       vendor                      "NVME"

       product                     "Pure Storage FlashArray"

       path_selector               "queue-length 0"

       path_grouping_policy        group_by_prio

       prio                        ana

       failback                    immediate

       fast_io_fail_tmo            10

       user_friendly_names         no

       no_path_retry               0

       features                    0

       dev_loss_tmo                60

   }

   device {

       vendor                   "PURE"

       product                  "FlashArray"

       path_selector            "service-time 0"

       hardware_handler         "1 alua"

       path_grouping_policy     group_by_prio

       prio                     alua

       failback                 immediate

       path_checker             tur

       fast_io_fail_tmo         10

       features                 0

       dev_loss_tmo             600

   }

}

blacklist_exceptions {

       property "(SCSI_IDENT_|ID_WWN)"

}

blacklist {

     devnode "^pxd[0-9]*"

     devnode "^pxd*"

     device {

       vendor "VMware"

       product "Virtual disk"

     }

}

```

## Configure Udev rules​

Configure queue settings with Udev rules on all nodes. For recommended settings for FlashArray, see Applying Queue Settings with Udev.

## Apply Multipath and Udev configurations​

Apply the Multipath and Udev configurations created in the previous sections for the changes to take effect.

Use a CloudInitConfig in SUSE Virtualization to apply multipath and Udev configuration files consistently across all nodes.

- Add the configuration files to the CloudInitConfig, as shown in the following example:

```

apiVersion: node.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1

kind: CloudInit

metadata:

  name: <your-cloudinit-config-name>

spec:

  contents: |

    stages:

      network:

      - name: "Configure pure storage"

        files:

        - path: /etc/udev/rules.d/99-pure-storage.rules

          permissions: 0644

          content: |

            <plaintext-udev_conf>

        - path: /etc/multipath.conf

          content: |

            <plaintext-multipath_conf>

          permissions: 0644

      - name: "Start multipathd service"

        systemctl:

          enable:

          - multipathd

          start:

          - multipathd

  filename: 99_multipathd.yaml

  matchSelector: {}

```

-
Apply the CloudInitConfig to your cluster:

```

kubectl apply -f <your-cloudinit-config-name>.yaml

```

## Set up user access in FlashArray​

To establish secure communication between Portworx and FlashArray, you must create a user account and generate an API token. This token serves as an authentication mechanism, allowing Portworx to interact with FlashArray and perform storage operations on behalf of the authorized user. This configuration ensures each tenant has access only to their assigned storage volumes.

This section provides the steps to generate an API token, which serves as your authorization within the FlashArray environment.

note

A FlashArray pod is a logical grouping on the storage array and is not related to Kubernetes pods.

-
Create a new user:

- In the FlashArray dashboard, from the left navigation pane, click Settings.
 The system displays the Settings page.

- Click the Access tab.

- In the Users section, click the vertical ellipsis on the top-right side, and select Create User.

- In the Create User window, enter the details and set the role as Storage Admin.

- Click Create to add the new user.

-
Generate an API token:

- To create a token for the user, select the user from the Users list, click the vertical ellipsis on the right-hand side of the username, and select Create API Token.

- In the API Token window, leave the Expires in field empty to create a token that never expires.

- Click Create.

- Save the token information to avoid needing to recreate it later.

## Create pure.json file​

To integrate Portworx Enterprise with FlashArray, create a JSON configuration file (named pure.json) containing essential information about the FlashArray environment. This file should include the management endpoints and the API token you generated.

- Management endpoints: These are URLs or IP addresses that Portworx uses to communicate with FlashArray through API calls. To locate these, go to Settings > Network in your FlashArray dashboard. Note the IP addresses or hostnames of your management interfaces, prefixed with vir, indicating virtual interfaces.

important

For an IPv6 address, ensure that the IP address is enclosed in square brackets. For example: "MgmtEndPoint": "[XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX]".

- API token: Generated in the previous section.

Use the information above to create a JSON file. The following is a template for the configuration content, which you must populate with your specific information:

note

If you are configuring both FlashArray and FlashBlade, you can add FlashBlade configuration information in the same file. For more information, see the JSON file.

```

{

  "FlashArrays": [

    {

      "MgmtEndPoint": "<fa-management-endpoint>",

      "APIToken": "<fa-api-token>"

    }

  ]

}

```

## Add FlashArray configuration to a kubernetes secret​

To enable Portworx Enterprise to access the FlashArray configuration, add the `pure.json` file to a Kubernetes secret by running the following command to create a secret named `px-pure-secret`:

```

kubectl create secret generic px-pure-secret --namespace <stc-namespace> --from-file=pure.json

```

```

secret/px-pure-secret created

```

important

- The specific name `px-pure-secret` is required so that Portworx Enterprise can correctly identify and access the Kubernetes secret upon startup. This secret securely stores the FlashArray configuration details and allows Portworx Enterprise to access this information within the Kubernetes environment.

- Ensure that the `px-pure-secret` is in the same namespace where you plan to install Portworx Enterprise.

## Generate Portworx Specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your SUSE Virtualization cluster by following these steps.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download.yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

note

You can either copy the `kubectl apply` command from the Central UI and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster, or download the YAML file and apply it using the file name.

## Deploy Portworx Operator​

Use the Operator specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy Portworx Operator by running the following command.

```

kubectl apply -f '<url-generated-from-portworx-central-spec-gen>'

```

```

namespace/portworx created

serviceaccount/portworx-operator created

clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

deployment.apps/portworx-operator created

```

## Deploy StorageCluster​

-
(Optional) If you are using SUSE Virtualization version 1.6.0 or later, do the following. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

- Create a Stork `SnapshotStorageClass` object.

```

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

kind: StorageClass

metadata:

  name: stork-snapshot-sc

  annotations:

    cdi.harvesterhci.io/storageProfileVolumeModeAccessModes: |

      {"Block":["ReadWriteOnce"]}

provisioner: stork-snapshot

allowVolumeExpansion: true

reclaimPolicy: Delete

volumeBindingMode: Immediate

```

- Apply the StorageClass:

```

kubectl apply -f stork-snapshot-sc.yaml

```

-
Use the StorageCluster specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy StorageCluster by running the following command.

```

kubectl apply -f '<url-generated-from-portworx-central-spec-gen>'

```

```

storagecluster.core.libopenstorage.org/px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8dfd338e915b created

```

After deployment, Portworx detects that the FlashArray secret is present when it starts up and can use the specified FlashArray as a storage provider.

## Create a StorageClass​

Create a StorageClass if one does not already exist. The following is an example StorageClass.

- Create the px-kubevirt-sc.yaml file:

StorageClass

```

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

kind: StorageClass

metadata:

  name: px-rwx-block-kubevirt

provisioner: pxd.portworx.com

parameters:

  cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.contentType: kubevirt

  repl: "3"

  nodiscard: "true" # Disables discard operations on the block device

volumeBindingMode: Immediate

allowVolumeExpansion: true

```

- Run the following command to apply your StorageClass:

```

  kubectl apply -f px-kubevirt-sc.yaml

```

## Update the CSI Driver Configuration​

-
Log in to the SUSE Virtualization UI.

-
Navigate to Advanced > Settings.

-
Search and select `csi-driver-config`.

-
Click the vertical ellipsis, and select Edit Setting to access the configuration options.

-
Set the Provisioner to the third-party CSI driver. `pxd.portworx.com`.

-
Configure the Volume Snapshot Class Name to `px-csi-snapclass`. This setting points to the name of the VolumeSnapshotClass used for creating volume snapshots or VM snapshots.

## Create a VM​

Refer to the applicable version of the SUSE Virtualization: Create a Virtual Machine guide and KubeVirt user guide to create a KubeVirt VM.

Once the VMs are created, each VM will start running in a `virt-launcher` pod.

## Verify Portworx Installation​

You can use the SUSE Virtualization console to verify that the VM is backed by Portworx and FlashArray.

-
Log in to the SUSE Virtualization console.

-
Go to Virtual Machines > Your VM > Volumes.

-
Confirm that the attached disk is the `px-rwx-block-kubevirt` StorageClass.
