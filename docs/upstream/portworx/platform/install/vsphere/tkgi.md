Installation on VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

Skip to main content

Version: 3.7

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx in a VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) environment. TKGI allows you to provision, operate, and manage vSphere-based Kubernetes clusters. You can deploy Portworx on TKGI environment using the shared datastores.

note

For the underlying datastore used by PVs and VMs, do not enable the Storage DRS feature. The vSphere CSI driver and Cloud Native Storage do not support Storage DRS in vSphere. For more information, see the vSphere CSI Driver supported features matrix.

The following diagram gives an overview of the Portworx architecture on vSphere using shared datastores.

- Portworx runs on each Kubernetes minion/worker.

- Based on the given spec by the end user, Portworx on each node will create its disk on the configured shared datastores or datastore clusters.

- Portworx will aggregate all of the disks and form a single storage cluster. End users can carve PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims), PVs (Persistent Volumes) and Snapshots from this storage cluster.

- Portworx tracks and manages the disks that it creates. In a failure event, if a new VM spins up, Portworx on the new VM will be able to attach to the same disk that was previously created by the node on the failed VM.

The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx on a TKGI environment:

- Enable privileged containers and allow kubectl exec access

- Configure the BOSH Director add-on

- Create shared datastores

- Create a vCenter user account for Portworx

- Create a secret with your vCenter user credentials

- Generate Portworx Specification

- Apply the specification

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Enable privileged containers and allow `kubectl exec` access​

Make sure the following settings are enabled for all plans in the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration Edition tile of Tanzu Operations Manager Interface:

- Enable Privileged Containers

- Disable DenyEscalatingExec to allow `kubectl exec` access for running `pxctl` commands.

## Configure the BOSH Director add-on​

The BOSH Director add-on enables upgrades to Portworx TKGI clusters with minimal disruption to availability and functionality.

During upgrade operations, the Kubernetes add-on expects all `sharedv4` volumes to be unmounted. The Portworx add-on unmounts these volumes to support zero-downtime upgrades.

You can perform the following steps from any machine that has access to the BOSH CLI.

### Upload a Portworx release to your Bosh Director environment​

-
Run the following commands to clone the `portworx-stop-bosh-release` repository and prepare the release:

```

git clone https://github.com/portworx/portworx-stop-bosh-release.git

cd portworx-stop-bosh-release

```

-
Create the Portworx release with a final version (in this example, version 2.0.0) using the Bosh CLI:

```

mkdir src

bosh create-release --final --version=2.0.0

```

-
Upload the release to your BOSH Director environment (replace director-environment with your environment name):

```

bosh -e director-environment upload-release

```

### Add the add-on to the BOSH Director​

-
Retrieve the current runtime configuration:

```

bosh -e director-environment runtime-config

```

- If this is empty, use the runtime config from runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml.

- If a runtime config already exists, add the release and add-on definitions from runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml into your current config.

-
Update the runtime config in the BOSH Director:

```

bosh -e director-environment update-runtime-config runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml

```

### Apply configuration changes in Tanzu Operations Manager​

- Log in to the Tanzu Operations Manager console.

- Go to the Installation Dashboard.

- Click Review Pending Changes, then select and apply the changes.

caution

If you cleared the Upgrade all clusters errands checkbox under Errands of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration Edition tile, run the following commands to reconfigure the add-on:

```

bosh manifest -d <deployment-name> > ./<deployment-name>-manifest.yaml

bosh -d <deployment-name> deploy ./<deployment-name>-manifest.yaml

```

For the required flags under the deploy command, see Deploy details in the Bosh documentation.

## Create shared datastores​

Create one or more shared datastores or datastore clusters dedicated to Portworx storage. Use a common prefix for the names of the datastores or datastore clusters. You must provide this prefix during the Portworx installation.

## Create a vCenter user account for Portworx​

Using your vSphere console, provide Portworx with a vCenter server user account that has the following minimum vSphere privileges at vCenter datacenter level:

-
Datastore

- Allocate space

- Browse datastore

- Low level file operations

- Remove file

-
Host

- Local operations

- Reconfigure virtual machine

-
Virtual machine

- Change Configuration

- Add existing disk

- Add new disk

- Add or remove device

- Advanced configuration

- Change Settings

- Extend virtual disk

- Modify device settings

- Remove disk

If you create a custom role as above, make sure to select Propagate to children when assigning the user to the role.

Why select `Propagate to Children` ?

In vSphere, resources are organized hierarchically. By selecting "Propagate to Children," you ensure that the permissions granted to the custom role are automatically applied not just to the targeted object, but also to all objects within its sub-tree. This includes VMs, datastores, networks, and other resources nested under the selected resource.

## Create a secret with your vCenter user credentials​

Create a secret using the following steps.

- Kubernetes Secret

- Vault Secret

-
Get VCenter user and password by running the following commands:

- For `VSPHERE_USER`: `echo '<vcenter-server-user>' | base64`

- For `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`: `echo '<vcenter-server-password>' | base64`

-
Update the following Kubernetes Secret template by using the values obtained in step 1 for `VSPHERE_USER` and `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`.

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: Secret

metadata:

  name: px-vsphere-secret

  namespace: <px-namespace>

type: Opaque

data:

  VSPHERE_USER: XXXX

  VSPHERE_PASSWORD: XXXX

```

-
Apply the above spec to update the spec with your VCenter username and password:

```

kubectl apply -f <updated-secret-template.yaml>

```

tip

To enable TLS certificate verification for vCenter, add the CA certificate used to verify the vCenter certificate to this secret with the `VSPHERE_CA_CERT` key. For more information, see Enable TLS Certificate Verification for vCenter.

When using Portworx with vSphere, you can supply the vSphere credentials by creating a secret in Vault. To configure and store secret key for vSphere in Vault, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Create the Secret​

Store vSphere credentials (username and password) as key-value pairs at the path `secret/vsphereCredentials`. If you are not using a custom backend path, use `secret` as shown. If you are using a custom secret path, replace secret with your custom path.

Run the following command, substituting the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```

vault kv put secret/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

If your custom secret path is, for example, customPath:

```

vault kv put customPath/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

#### Step 2: Retrieve and Verify the Secret​

To ensure that the secret was created correctly, use this command:

```

vault kv get secret/vsphereCredentials

```

The command should return an output similar to the following:

```

========== Data ==========

Key                 Value

---                 -----

VSPHERE_PASSWORD    <vsphere_password>

VSPHERE_USER        <vsphere_user>

```

important

- Ensure that the correct vSphere credentials are securely stored in Vault before Portworx installation.

- Ensure that the ports 17001-17020 on worker nodes are reachable from the control plane node and other worker nodes.

## Generate Portworx Specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your vSphere Kubernetes cluster by following these steps.

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- Select the Secrets Store Type from the dropdown menu to store and manage secure information for features such as CloudSnaps and Encryption.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download.yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.
