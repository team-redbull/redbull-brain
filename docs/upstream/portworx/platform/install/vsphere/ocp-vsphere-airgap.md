Installation on Air-Gapped vSphere OpenShift Cluster | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx on an air-gapped VMware vSphere OpenShift cluster using the internal OpenShift cluster registry.

The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx Enterprise on an air-gapped VMware vSphere OpenShift cluster:

- Configure your Environment

- Create a version manifest configmap for Portworx Operator

- Generate Portworx Specification

- Deploy Portworx Operator

- Deploy StorageCluster

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify Portworx Pool Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Configure your Environment​

-
On your internet-connected host, set an environment variable for the Kubernetes version that you are using:

```

KBVER=$(oc version | awk -F'[v+_-]' '/Kubernetes/ {print $2}')

```

-
Set an environment variable to the latest major version of Portworx:

```

PXVER=<portworx-version>

```

-
On an internet-connected host with the same architecture and OS version as the Kubernetes cluster nodes intended for Portworx installation, download the air-gapped installation bootstrap script for the specified Kubernetes and Portworx versions:

```

curl -o px-ag-install.sh -L "https://install.portworx.com/$PXVER/air-gapped?kbver=$KBVER"

```

-
Pull the container images required for the specified versions:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh pull

```

-
Authenticate to the OpenShift internal registry.

For example:

```

oc login -u admin -p password https://api.lab.ocp.lan:6443

```

```

Login successful.

[...]

Using project "default".

```

-
Log in to your registry, substituting `docker` for `podman` if you are not using Podman.

For example:

```

podman login -u admin -p $(oc whoami -t) default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.lab.ocp.lan

```

```

Login Succeeded!

```

note

If the host you're running Podman from does not have the cluster's certificate authority in its trusted-stores, you will need to pass the `--tls-verify=false` flag to the login command.

-
Push the container images to your internal OpenShift cluster registry.

For example:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.lab.ocp.lan/kube-system

```

-
Create a secret for the Operator to use that contains the registry credentials.

For example:

```

oc -n portworx create secret docker-registry px-image-repository \

    --docker-server=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000 \

    --docker-username=admin \

    --docker-password=$(oc whoami -t)

```

```

Login Succeeded!

```

## Create a version manifest configmap for Portworx Operator​

-
Download the Portworx version manifest:

```

curl -o versions.yaml "https://install.portworx.com/$<portworx-version>/version?kbver=$<kubernetes-version>&opver=$<operator-version>"

```

Replace:

- `<portworx_version>` with the Portworx version you want to use.

- `<kubernetes-version>` with the Kubernetes version you want to use.

- `<operator-version>` with the Operator version you want to use.

-
Create a configmap from the downloaded `versions.yaml`:

```

oc -n portworx create configmap px-versions --from-file=versions.yaml

```

## Create a vCenter user account for Portworx​

- Using your vSphere console, provide Portworx with a vCenter Server user account that has the following minimum vSphere privileges at vCenter Server datacenter level:

-
Datastore

- Allocate space

- Browse datastore

- Low level file operations

- Remove file

-
Host

- Local operations

- Reconfigure virtual machine

-
Virtual machine

- Change Configuration

- Add existing disk

- Add new disk

- Add or remove device

- Advanced configuration

- Change Settings

- Extend virtual disk

- Modify device settings

- Remove disk

If you create a custom role as above, make sure to select Propagate to children when assigning the user to the role.

Why select `Propagate to Children` ?

In vSphere, resources are organized hierarchically. By selecting "Propagate to Children," you ensure that the permissions granted to the custom role are automatically applied not just to the targeted object, but also to all objects within its sub-tree. This includes VMs, datastores, networks, and other resources nested under the selected resource.

## Provide the vCenter user credentials​

In order to grant Portworx the necessary permissions for managing the storage block devices that the storage nodes require, create a secret with user credentials.

- Kubernetes Secret

- Vault Secret

-
Get the vCenter Server username and password by running the following commands:

- For `VSPHERE_USER`: `echo '<vcenter-server-user>' | base64`

- For `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`: `echo '<vcenter-server-password>' | base64`

-
Update the following Kubernetes Secret template by using the values obtained in step 1 for `VSPHERE_USER` and `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`.

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: Secret

metadata:

  name: px-vsphere-secret

  namespace: <px-namespace>

type: Opaque

data:

  VSPHERE_USER: XXXX

  VSPHERE_PASSWORD: XXXX

```

-
Apply the above spec to update the spec with your vCenter Server username and password:

```

oc apply -f <updated-secret-template.yaml>

```

tip

To enable TLS certificate verification for vCenter, add the CA certificate used to verify the vCenter certificate to this secret with the `VSPHERE_CA_CERT` key. For more information, see Enable TLS Certificate Verification for vCenter.

When using Portworx with vSphere, you can supply the vSphere credentials by creating a secret in Vault. Follow the steps below to properly create and verify the secret.

#### Step 1: Create the Secret​

Store vSphere credentials (username and password) as key-value pairs at the path `secret/vsphereCredentials`. If you are not using a custom backend path, use `secret` as shown. If you are using a custom secret path, replace `secret` with your custom path.

Run the following command, substituting the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```

vault kv put secret/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

If your custom secret path is, for example, customPath:

```

vault kv put customPath/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

#### Step 2: Retrieve and Verify the Secret​

To ensure that the secret was created correctly, use this command:

```

vault kv get secret/vsphereCredentials

```

The command should return an output similar to the following:

```

========== Data ==========

Key                 Value

---                 -----

VSPHERE_PASSWORD    <vsphere_password>

VSPHERE_USER        <vsphere_user>

```

important

- Ensure that the correct vSphere credentials are securely stored in Vault before Portworx installation.

- Ensure that the ports 17001-17020 on worker nodes are reachable from the control plane node and other worker nodes.

## Generate Portworx Specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your vSphere OpenShift cluster by following these steps.

-
In the Configure Secret Details section:

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- To use a key management service (KMS) to store encryption keys, secrets, or credentials for features such as CloudSnap, volume encryption, or cloud provider integrations, select the appropriate KMS from the Default Secrets Store Type dropdown menu. For more information, see Set Up Key Management and Encrypt Portworx Volumes.

- Click the toggle button to Configure Secrets Store Type per Feature. Configure multiple secret providers and assign a different secret store to each feature. If you enable the toggle and do not select the secrets store for the features, Portworx Enterprise uses Default Secret Store Type for cloud provider credentials. For more information, see Configure multiple secrets providers.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Cloud Provider Credentials feature from the dropdown menu.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Volume Encryption feature from the dropdown menu.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Cloud Snap feature from the dropdown menu.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

## Deploy Portworx Operator​

Use the Operator specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy Portworx Operator by running the following command:

```

oc apply -f 'https://install.portworx.com/<PXVER>?comp=pxoperator&reg=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kube-system'

```

## Deploy StorageCluster​

-
Use the StorageCluster specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy StorageCluster by running the following command:

```

oc apply -f '<storagecluster-deployment-URL>'

```

```

storagecluster.core.libopenstorage.org/px-cluster-<randomUUID> created

```

note

If you installed the Portworx Operator manually, run the following command to annotate the newly created StorageCluster and identify it as an OpenShift environment:

```

 oc -n kube-system annotate stc $(oc -n kube-system get stc -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 'portworx.io/is-openshift=true'

```

-
(Optional) If you have a disaggregated setup, after you generate the StorageCluster spec, you must create two separate node sections in the spec to define the device settings for the storage and storageless (compute) nodes.
 Here is a sample StorageCluster spec that uses node-specific overrides:

```

apiVersion: core.libopenstorage.org/v1

kind: StorageCluster

metadata:

  name: portworx

  namespace: <px-namespace>

spec:

  image: portworx/oci-monitor:2.10.1

  storage:

    devices:

      - /dev/sda

      - /dev/sdb

  nodes:

    - selector:

        labelSelector:

          matchLabels:

            portworx.io/node-type: "storage"

      storage:

        devices:

          - /dev/nvme1

          - /dev/nvme2

    - selector:

        labelSelector:

          matchLabels:

            portworx.io/node-type: "storageless"

      storage:

        devices: []

```

In this example, Portworx on the nodes labeled as `portworx.io/node-type=storage` expects two disks, `/dev/nvme1` and `/dev/nvme2`, and it runs them as storage nodes. On the other hand, Portworx on the nodes labeled as `portworx.io/node-type=storageless` ignores any disks that might be found on the node and run as storageless nodes.

## Verify Portworx Pod Status​

Run the following command to list and filter the results for Portworx pods and specify the namespace where you have deployed Portworx:

```

oc get pods -n <px-namespace> -o wide | grep -e portworx -e px

```

```

Status displays `PX is operational` when the cluster is running as expected. If the cluster is using the PX-StoreV2 datastore, the `StorageNode` entries for each node displays `Yes(PX-StoreV2)`.

## Verify Portworx Pool Status​

note

This procedure is applicable for clusters with PX-StoreV2 datastore.

Run the following command to view the Portworx drive configurations for your pod:

```

oc exec <px-pod>  -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl service pool show

```

```

Defaulted container "portworx" out of: portworx, csi-node-driver-registrar

PX drive configuration:

Pool ID: 0

    Type:  PX-StoreV2

    UUID:  58ab2e3f-a22e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

    IO Priority:  HIGH

    Labels:  kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=username-vms-silver-sight-3,kubernetes.io/os=linux,medium=STORAGE_MEDIUM_SSD,beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,iopriority=HIGH

    Size: 25 GiB

    Status: Online

    Has metadata:  No

    Balanced:  Yes

    Drives:

    0: /dev/sda, Total size 32 GiB, Online

    Cache Drives:

    No Cache drives found in this pool

Metadata  Device:

    1: /dev/sdd, STORAGE_MEDIUM_SSD

```

The output `Type: PX-StoreV2` ensures that the pod uses the PX-StoreV2 datastore.

## Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status​

-
Access the Portworx CLI.

-
Run the following command to find the storage cluster:

```

oc -n <px-namespace> get storagecluster

```

```

NAME                                              CLUSTER UUID                           STATUS   VERSION          AGE

```

The status must display the cluster is `Online`.

-
Run the following command to find the storage nodes:

```

oc -n <px-namespace> get storagenodes

```

```

NAME                          ID                                     STATUS   VERSION          AGE

username-vms-silver-sight-3   24508311-e2fe-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   Online   3.2.0-28944c8   3h25m

```

The status must display the nodes are `Online`.

-
Verify the Portworx cluster provision status by running the following command.
 Specify the pod name you retrieved in Verify Portworx Pod Status.

```

oc exec <px-pod> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cluster provision-status

```

```
