Skip to main content

Version: 3.7

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx on a non-air-gapped VMware vSphere Kubernetes cluster.

The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx on a non-air-gapped VMware vSphere Kubernetes cluster:

- Create a vCenter user account for Portworx

- Create a secret with your vCenter user credentials

- Generate Portworx Specification

- Deploy Portworx Operator

- Deploy StorageCluster

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify Portworx Pool Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Create a vCenter user account for Portworx​

Using your vSphere console, provide Portworx with a vCenter server user account that has the following minimum vSphere privileges at vCenter datacenter level:

-
Datastore

- Allocate space

- Browse datastore

- Low level file operations

- Remove file

-
Host

- Local operations

- Reconfigure virtual machine

-
Virtual machine

- Change Configuration

- Add existing disk

- Add new disk

- Add or remove device

- Advanced configuration

- Change Settings

- Extend virtual disk

- Modify device settings

- Remove disk

If you create a custom role as above, make sure to select Propagate to children when assigning the user to the role.

Why select `Propagate to Children` ?

In vSphere, resources are organized hierarchically. By selecting "Propagate to Children," you ensure that the permissions granted to the custom role are automatically applied not just to the targeted object, but also to all objects within its sub-tree. This includes VMs, datastores, networks, and other resources nested under the selected resource.

## Create a secret with your vCenter user credentials​

Create a secret using the following steps.

- Kubernetes Secret

- Vault Secret

-
Get VCenter user and password by running the following commands:

- For `VSPHERE_USER`: `echo '<vcenter-server-user>' | base64`

- For `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`: `echo '<vcenter-server-password>' | base64`

-
Update the following Kubernetes Secret template by using the values obtained in step 1 for `VSPHERE_USER` and `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`.

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: Secret

metadata:

  name: px-vsphere-secret

  namespace: <px-namespace>

type: Opaque

data:

  VSPHERE_USER: XXXX

  VSPHERE_PASSWORD: XXXX

```

-
Apply the above spec to update the spec with your VCenter username and password:

```

kubectl apply -f <updated-secret-template.yaml>

```

tip

To enable TLS certificate verification for vCenter, add the CA certificate used to verify the vCenter certificate to this secret with the `VSPHERE_CA_CERT` key. For more information, see Enable TLS Certificate Verification for vCenter.

When using Portworx with vSphere, you can supply the vSphere credentials by creating a secret in Vault. Follow the steps below to properly create and verify the secret.

#### Step 1: Create the Secret​

Store vSphere credentials (username and password) as key-value pairs at the path `secret/vsphereCredentials`. If you are not using a custom backend path, use `secret` as shown. If you are using a custom secret path, replace `secret` with your custom path.

Run the following command, substituting the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```

vault kv put secret/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

If your custom secret path is, for example, customPath:

```

vault kv put customPath/vsphereCredentials VSPHERE_PASSWORD=<vsphere_password> VSPHERE_USER=<vsphere_user>

```

#### Step 2: Retrieve and Verify the Secret​

To ensure that the secret was created correctly, use this command:

```

vault kv get secret/vsphereCredentials

```

The command should return an output similar to the following:

```

========== Data ==========

Key                 Value

---                 -----

VSPHERE_PASSWORD    <vsphere_password>

VSPHERE_USER        <vsphere_user>

```

important

- Ensure that the correct vSphere credentials are securely stored in Vault before Portworx installation.

- Ensure that the ports 17001-17020 on worker nodes are reachable from the control plane node and other worker nodes.

## Generate Portworx Specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your vSphere Kubernetes cluster by following these steps.

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In the Portworx Enterprise section, select Generate Cluster Spec.
 The system displays the Generate Spec page.

-
From the Portworx Version dropdown menu, select the Portworx version to install.

-
From the Platform dropdown menu, select vSphere.

-
In the vCenter Endpoint field, specify the hostname or the IP address of the vSphere server.

-
In the vCenter Datastore Prefix field, specify the datastore name(s) or datastore cluster name(s) available for Portworx.
To specify multiple datastore names or datastore cluster names, enter a generic prefix common to all the datastores or datastore clusters. For example, if you want Portworx to use three datastores named `px-datastore-01`, `px-datastore-02`, and `px-datastore-03`, specify `px` or `px-datastore`.

-
From the Distribution Name dropdown menu, select None.

important

The deployment process for Kubernetes distributions such as Google Anthos, Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2), or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) is identical to deploying Portworx on a vSphere Kubernetes cluster. However, you must select Anthos, Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2), or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) from the Distribution Name dropdown, based on your Kubernetes environment and deployment requirements. This ensures that the deployment manifest is correctly tailored for Anthos, RKE2, or TKGI.

-
(Only if you choose Anthos as the Distribution Name) In the Cluster Selector Label field, enter an appropriate label for the cluster.
 This label helps you specify which configurations or software installations apply only to clusters that match the label criteria. For example, when installing Portworx on an Anthos cluster, you might want to target only clusters designated for storage-intensive applications. In this case, label your target cluster with a specific selector:

```

metadata:

labels:

configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector: storage-intensive

```

This ensures that Portworx is only installed on clusters designated for storage-heavy workloads, optimizing resource usage and deployment strategies across your Anthos environment.

-
(Optional) To customize the configuration options and generate a custom specification, click Customize and perform the following steps:

note

To continue without customizing the default configuration or generating a custom specification, proceed to Step 10.

- Basic tab:

- To use an existing etcd cluster, do the following:

- Select the Your etcd details option.

- In the field provided, enter the host name or IP and port number. For example, `http://test.com.net:1234`.
 To add another etcd cluster, click the + icon.

note

You can add up to three etcd clusters.

- Select one of the following authentication methods:

- Disable HTTPS – To use HTTP for etcd communication.

- Certificate Auth – To use HTTPS with an SSL certificate.
For more information, see Secure your etcd communication.

- Password Auth – To use HTTPS with username and password authentication.

- To use an internal Portworx-managed key-value store (kvdb), do the following:

- Select the Built-in option.

- TLS for internal KVDB is enabled, by default. If Cert-Manager is already running in your Kubernetes cluster, deselect the Deploy Cert-Manager for TLS certificates option to avoid installation failures.

- Select Next.

- Storage tab:

- To enable Portworx to provision drives using a specification, do the following:

- Select the Create Using a Spec option.

- Select PX-Store Version: (Optional) To designate PX-StoreV1 as the datastore, select PX-StoreV1. By default, the system selects PX-StoreV2 as the datastore.

- To add one or more storage drive types for Portworx to use, click + Add Drive and select one of the following types of drives:

- Lazy-Zeroed Thick

- Eager-Zeroed Thick

- Thin

note

The system automatically selects the minimum number of drives to ensure optimal performance.

- Configure the following fields for the drive:

- Size (GB) - Specify the size of the drive in gigabytes.

- Action - Use the trash icon to remove a drive type from the configuration.

- (Optional) To add more storage drives, click one of the following options based on the drive type:

- + Add Lazy-Zeroed Thick Drives

- + Add Eager-Zeroed Thick Drives

- + Add Thin Drives

- Initial Storage Nodes (Optional): Enter the number of storage nodes that need to be created across zones and node pools.

 Details

In Anthos clusters, management operations such as upgrades recycle cluster nodes by deleting and recreating them. During this process, the cluster may temporarily scale beyond its original size. For example, a three-node cluster may temporarily scale up to four nodes. To prevent Portworx from creating storage on these additional nodes, you must cap the number of Portworx nodes that acts as storage nodes. You can set this value in the Initial Storage Nodes field according to the following requirements:

- If your Anthos cluster does not have zones configured, this number should be your initial number of cluster nodes,

- If your Anthos cluster has zones configured, this number should be an initial number of cluster nodes per zone.

- From the Default IO Profile dropdown menu, select Auto.
This enables Portworx to automatically choose the best I/O profile based on detected workload patterns.

- From the Journal Device dropdown menu, select one of the following:

- None – To use the default journaling setting.

- Auto – To automatically allocate journal devices.

- Custom – To manually choose a volume type for the journal device.

- In the vCenter Endpoint field, enter the hostname or IP of your vCenter server.

- In the vCenter Port field, enter the port number of your vCenter server.

- In the vSphere Credentials Store, select one of the following options to provide vSphere credentials:

- Kubernetes – Select this option to use the Kubernetes secret created in Create a secret with your vCenter user and password step.

- Vault – Select this option to use Vault as your secret provider.

- Ensure that the Kubernetes Secret Name exists in cluster before installing Portworx.

- To enable Portworx to use all available, unused, and unmounted drives on the node, do the following:

- Select the Consume Unused option.

- (Optional) To designate PX-StoreV1 as the datastore, clear the PX-StoreV2 checkbox. By default, the system selects PX-StoreV2 as the datastore.

- For PX-StoreV2, in the Metadata Path field, enter a pre-provisioned path for storing the Portworx metadata.
The path must be at least 64 GB in size.

- From the Journal Device dropdown menu, select one of the following:

- None – To use the default journaling setting.

- Auto – To automatically allocate journal devices.

- Custom – To manually enter a journal device path.
Enter the path of the journal device in the Journal Device Path field.

- Select the Use unmounted disks even if they have a partition or filesystem on it. Portworx will never use a drive or partition that is mounted checkbox to use unmounted disks, even if they contain a partition or filesystem.
Portworx will not use any mounted drive or partition.

- To enable Portworx to use existing drives on a node, do the following:

- Select the Use Existing Drives option.

- (Optional) To designate PX-StoreV1 as the datastore, clear the PX-StoreV2 checkbox. By default, the system selects PX-StoreV2 as the datastore.

- For PX-StoreV2 checkbox, in the Metadata Path field, enter a pre-provisioned path for storing the Portworx metadata.
The path must be at least 64 GB in size.

- In the Drive/Device field, specify the block drive(s) that Portworx uses for data storage.
To add another block drive, click the + icon.

- (Optional) In the Pool Label field, assign a custom label in key:value format to identify and categorize storage pools.

For more information, see Enable Pure1 integration for upgrades on a VMware vSphere cluster.

-
In the Configure Secret Details section:

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- To use a key management service (KMS) to store encryption keys, secrets, or credentials for features such as CloudSnap, volume encryption, or cloud provider integrations, select the appropriate KMS from the Default Secrets Store Type dropdown menu. For more information, see Set Up Key Management and Encrypt Portworx Volumes.

- Click the toggle button to Configure Secrets Store Type per Feature. Configure multiple secret providers and assign a different secret store to each feature. If you enable the toggle and do not select the secrets store for the features, Portworx Enterprise uses Default Secret Store Type for cloud provider credentials. For more information, see Configure multiple secrets providers.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Cloud Provider Credentials feature from the dropdown menu.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Volume Encryption feature from the dropdown menu.

- Select the Secret Store Type for Cloud Snap feature from the dropdown menu.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download.yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

-
Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

-
(Only if you choose Anthos as the Distribution Name) Extract the .zip file you download in Step 10 or after you finish customizing the specification, as shown below. Replace the zip file name with your downloaded .zip file name:

```

unzip <portworx-anthos-label-2025-09-19-11-07-32.zip>

```

```

px-operator-portworx-label-2025-09-19-11-07-32.yaml

storage-cluster-portworx-label-2025-09-19-11-07-32.yaml

```

You will get the `px-operator` and `storage-cluster` YAML files.

## Deploy Portworx Operator​

- Other Distributions

- Anthos

Use the Operator specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy Portworx Operator by running the following command.

```

kubectl apply -f 'https://install.portworx.com/<PXVER>?comp=pxoperator'

```

```

serviceaccount/portworx-operator created

podsecuritypolicy.policy/px-operator created

clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

deployment.apps/portworx-operator created

```

Run the following command to deploy the Portworx Operator. Replace the Portworx Enterprise Operator file name with your downloaded file name:

```

kubectl create -f <px-operator-namespace-label-2025-09-19-11-07-32.yaml>

```

```

serviceaccount/portworx-operator created

clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

deployment.apps/portworx-operator created

```

## Deploy StorageCluster​

- Other Distributions

- Anthos

-
Use the StorageCluster specifications you generated in the Generate Portworx Specification section, and deploy StorageCluster by running the following command.

```

kubectl apply -f 'https://install.portworx.com/<PXVER>?operator=true&mc=false&kbver=&b=true&c=px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8dfd338e915b&stork=true&csi=true&mon=true&tel=false&st=k8s&promop=true'

```

```

storagecluster.core.libopenstorage.org/px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8dfd338e915b created

```

-
(Optional) If you have a disaggregated setup, after you generate the StorageCluster spec, you must create two separate node sections in the spec to define the device settings for the storage and storageless (compute) nodes.
 Here is a sample StorageCluster spec that uses node-specific overrides:

```

apiVersion: core.libopenstorage.org/v1

kind: StorageCluster

metadata:

name: portworx

namespace: <px-namespace>

spec:

image: portworx/oci-monitor:2.10.1

storage:

    devices:

    - /dev/sda

    - /dev/sdb

nodes:

- selector:

    labelSelector:

        matchLabels:

        portworx.io/node-type: "storage"

    storage:

    devices:

    - /dev/nvme1

    - /dev/nvme2

- selector:

    labelSelector:

        matchLabels:

        portworx.io/node-type: "storageless"

    storage:

    devices: []

```

In this example, Portworx on the nodes labeled as `portworx.io/node-type=storage` expects two disks, `/dev/nvme1` and `/dev/nvme2`, and it runs them as storage nodes. On the other hand, Portworx on the nodes labeled as `portworx.io/node-type=storageless` ignores any disks that might be found on the node and run as storageless nodes.

-
Run the following command to deploy the StorageCluster. Replace the Portworx Enterprise StorageCluster file name with your downloaded file name:

```

kubectl create -f <storage-cluster-namespace-label-2025-09-19-11-07-32.yaml >

```

```

storagecluster.core.libopenstorage.org/px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-f50775cb041b created

```

-
(Optional) If you have a disaggregated setup, after you generate the StorageCluster spec in the Generate Portworx Specification section, add the following environment variable in the env section:

```

spec:

env:

- name: ENABLE_ASG_STORAGE_PARTITIONING

value: "true"

```

You can also add the environment variables from the spec generator using the Environment Variables dropdown menu.
 After you add the variable, Portworx runs nodes labeled `portworx.io/node-type=storage` as storage nodes and nodes labeled `portworx.io/node-type=storageless` as storageless nodes.

## Verify Portworx Pod Status​

Enter the following command to list and filter the results for Portworx pods and specify the namespace where you have deployed Portworx:

```

kubectl get pods -n <px-namespace> -o wide | grep -e portworx -e px

```

```

```

Note the name of a `px-cluster` pod. You will run `pxctl` commands from these pods in Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status.

## Verify Portworx Cluster Status​

You can find the status of the Portworx cluster by running `pxctl status` commands from a pod.
Enter the following `kubectl exec` command, specifying the pod name you retrieved in Verify Portworx Pod Status:

```

kubectl exec <pod-name> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status

```

```

Status displays `PX is operational` when the cluster is running as expected. If the cluster is using the PX-StoreV2 datastore, the `StorageNode` entries for each node displays `Yes(PX-StoreV2)`.

## Verify Portworx Pool Status​

note

This procedure is applicable for clusters with PX-StoreV2 datastore.

Run the following command to view the Portworx drive configurations for your pod:

```

kubectl exec <px-pod>  -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl service pool show

```

```

Defaulted container "portworx" out of: portworx, csi-node-driver-registrar

PX drive configuration:

Pool ID: 0

    Type:  PX-StoreV2

    UUID:  58ab2e3f-a22e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

    IO Priority:  HIGH

    Labels:  kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=username-vms-silver-sight-3,kubernetes.io/os=linux,medium=STORAGE_MEDIUM_SSD,beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,iopriority=HIGH

    Size: 25 GiB

    Status: Online

    Has metadata:  No

    Balanced:  Yes

    Drives:

    0: /dev/sda, Total size 32 GiB, Online

    Cache Drives:

    No Cache drives found in this pool

Metadata  Device:

    1: /dev/sdd, STORAGE_MEDIUM_SSD

```

The output `Type: PX-StoreV2` ensures that the pod uses the PX-StoreV2 datastore.

## Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status​

-
Access the Portworx CLI.

-
Run the following command to find the storage cluster:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get storagecluster

```

```

NAME                                              CLUSTER UUID                           STATUS   VERSION   AGE

px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3e9bf3cd834d   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-6f3fd5522eae   Online   2.11.0    10m

```

The status must display the cluster is `Online`.

-
Run the following command to find the storage nodes:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get storagenodes

```

```

NAME                  ID                                     STATUS   VERSION          AGE

username-k8s1-node0   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-fad8c65b8edc   Online   2.11.0-81faacc   11m

username-k8s1-node1   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-70c31d0f478e   Online   2.11.0-81faacc   11m

username-k8s1-node2   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-19d45b4c541a   Online   2.11.0-81faacc   11m

```

The status must display the nodes are `Online`.

-
Verify the Portworx cluster provision status by running the following command.
 Specify the pod name you retrieved in Verify Portworx Pod Status.

```

kubectl exec <px-pod> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cluster provision-status

```

```
