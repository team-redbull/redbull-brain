Installation on a Non-Air-Gapped Bare Metal OpenShift Cluster | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx on a non-air-gapped bare metal OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx on a bare metal OpenShift cluster:

- Create a monitoring ConfigMap

- Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification

- Install Portworx Operator using OpenShift Console

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify Portworx Pool Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Create a Monitoring ConfigMap​

Enable monitoring for user-defined projects before installing the Portworx Operator. Use the instructions in this section to configure the OpenShift Prometheus deployment to monitor Portworx metrics.

To integrate OpenShift’s monitoring and alerting system with Portworx, create a `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: ConfigMap

metadata:

  name: cluster-monitoring-config

  namespace: openshift-monitoring

data:

  config.yaml: |

    enableUserWorkload: true

```

The `enableUserWorkload` parameter enables monitoring for user-defined projects in the OpenShift cluster. This creates a `prometheus-operated` service in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

## Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your bare metal OpenShift cluster by following these steps.

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In the Portworx Enterprise section, select Generate Cluster Spec.
 The system displays the Generate Spec page.

-
From the Portworx Version dropdown menu, select the Portworx version to install.

-
From the Platform dropdown menu, select DAS/SAN.

-
From the Distribution Name dropdown menu, select OpenShift 4+.

-
(Optional) To customize the configuration options and generate a custom specification, click Customize and perform the following steps:

note

To continue without customizing the default configuration or generating a custom specification, proceed to Step 7.

- Basic tab:

-
To use an existing etcd cluster, do the following:

- Select the Your etcd details option.

- In the field provided, enter the host name or IP and port number. For example, `http://test.com.net:1234`.
 To add another etcd cluster, click the + icon.

note

You can add up to three etcd clusters.

- Select one of the following authentication methods:

- Disable HTTPS – To use HTTP for etcd communication.

- Certificate Auth – To use HTTPS with an SSL certificate.
For more information, see Secure your etcd communication.

- Password Auth – To use HTTPS with username and password authentication.

-
To use an internal Portworx-managed key-value store (kvdb), do the following:

- Select the Built-in option.

- TLS for internal KVDB is enabled, by default. If Cert-Manager is already running in your Kubernetes cluster, deselect the Deploy Cert-Manager for TLS certificates option to avoid installation failures.

-
Click Next.

- Storage tab:

- To enable Portworx to use all available, unused, and unmounted drives on the node, do the following:

- Select the Automatically scan disks option.

- From the Default IO Profile dropdown menu, select Auto.
 This enables Portworx to automatically choose the best I/O profile based on detected workload patterns.

- Select the Use unmounted disks even if they have a partition or filesystem on it. Portworx will never use a drive or partition that is mounted checkbox to use unmounted disks, even if they contain a partition or filesystem.
Portworx will not use any mounted drive or partition.

- To manually specify the drives on the node for Portworx to use, do the following:

- Select the Manually specify disks option.

- In the Drive/Device field, specify the block drive(s) that Portworx uses for data storage.
To add another block drive, click the + icon.

- (Optional) In the Pool Label field, assign a custom label in `key:value` format to identify and categorize storage pools.

- (Optional) To designate PX-StoreV1 as the datastore, clear the PX-StoreV2 checkbox. By default, the system selects PX-StoreV2 as the datastore.

- For PX-StoreV2, in the Metadata Path field, enter a pre-provisioned path for storing the Portworx metadata.
The path must be at least 64 GB in size.

- From the Journal Device dropdown menu, select one of the following:

- None – To use the default journaling setting.

- Auto – To automatically allocate journal devices.

- Custom – To manually enter a journal device path.
Enter the path of the journal device in the Journal Device Path field.

- Skip KVDB device - This checkbox is selected by default and appears only if you choose the Built-in option in the Basic tab.
Keep it selected to use the same device for KVDB and storage I/O. This configuration is suitable for test or development clusters but not recommended for production clusters. For production clusters, clear the checkbox and provide a separate device to store internal KVDB data. This separates KVDB I/O from storage I/O and improves performance.

- KVDB device - Enter the block device path to be used exclusively for KVDB data.
This field appears only if you clear the Skip KVDB device checkbox. The KVDB device must be present on at least three nodes in the cluster to ensure high availability.

note

To restrict Portworx to run internal KVDB only on specific nodes, label those nodes with:

```

kubectl label nodes node1 node2 node3 px/metadata-node=true

```

- Click Next.

- Network tab:

- In the Interface(s) section, do the following:

- Enter the Data Network Interface to be used for data traffic.

- Enter the Management Network Interface to be used for management traffic.

- In the Advanced Settings section, do the following:

- Enter the Starting port for Portworx services.

- Click Next.

- Deployment tab:

-
In the Kubernetes Distribution section, under Are you running on either of these?, select Openshift 4+.

-
In the Component Settings section:

- Select the Enable Stork checkbox to enable Stork.

- Select the Restrict Data Protection RBAC to restrict RBAC permissions for Stork (if enabled). You will not be able to use Backup and DR capabilities with this restriction. For more information, see Restrict Data Protection RBAC.

- Select the Enable Monitoring checkbox to enable monitoring of Portworx components and resources.

- To configure the monitoring stack, select one of the following:

- Portworx Managed - To enable Portworx to install and manage Prometheus and Operator automatically.
 Ensure that no other Prometheus Operator instance already running on the cluster.

- User Managed - To configure and manage your own monitoring stack.

- Select the Enable Autopilot checkbox to enable Portworx Autopilot. For User Managed monitoring stack, Portworx supports the following metrics providers that Autopilot will use to fetch metrics for rule evaluation and automated actions.

- Prometheus - Provide a valid Prometheus URL

- Datadog - Provide a valid Datadog URL, Secret Name and Secret Namespace. To create a Secret, refer to enable Datadog.
 For more information on Autopilot, see Expanding your Storage Pool with Autopilot.

- Select the Enable Telemetry checkbox to enable telemetry in the StorageCluster spec.
For more information, see Enable Pure1 integration for upgrades on bare metal.

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- Select the Secrets Store Type from the dropdown menu to store and manage secure information for features such as CloudSnaps and Encryption.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

-
Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

## Install Portworx Operator using OpenShift Console​

 From the OpenShift UI, go to OperatorHub, search for Portworx Operator, and the Portworx Operator page appears.

-
Click Install.
The system initiates the Portworx Operator installation and displays the Install Operator page.

-
In the Installation mode section, select A specific namespace on the cluster.

-
From the Installed Namespace dropdown, choose Create Project.
The system displays the Create Project window.

-
Provide the name `portworx` and click Create to create a namespace called portworx.

-
In the Console plugin section, select Enable to manage your Portworx cluster using the Portworx dashboard within the OpenShift console.

note

If the Portworx Operator is installed but the OpenShift Console plugin is not enabled, or was previously disabled, you can re-enable it by running the following command.

```

oc patch console.operator cluster --type=json -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/plugins/-","value":"portworx"}]'

```

-
Click Install to deploy Portworx Operator in the `portworx` namespace.
After you successfully install Portworx Operator, the system displays the Create StorageCluster option.

## Deploying Portworx using OpenShift Console​

-

-
Select YAML view.

-
Copy and paste the specification that you generated in Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification section into the text editor.

-
Click Create.
 The system deploys Portworx, and displays the Portworx instance in the Storage Cluster tab of the Installed Operators page.

note

For clusters with PX-StoreV2 datastores, after you deploy Portworx, the Portworx Operator performs a pre-flight check across the cluster, and the check must pass on each node. This check determines whether each node in the cluster is compatible with the PX-StoreV2 datastore. If each node meets the following hardware and software requirements, PX-StoreV2 is automatically set as the default datastore during Portworx installation.

- Hardware:

- CPU: A minimum of 8 cores CPU per node.

- Drive type: SD/NVME drive with a memory of more than 8 GB per node.

- Metadata device: A minimum of 64 GB system metadata device on each node.

- Software:

- Linux kernel version: 4.20 or later with the Rhel packages device-mapper mdadm lvm2 device-mapper-persistent-data augeas

## Verify Portworx Pod Status​

Run the following command to list and filter the results for Portworx pods and specify the namespace where you have deployed Portworx:

```

oc get pods -n <px-namespace> -o wide | grep -e portworx -e px

```

```
