Installation on an Air-Gapped Bare Metal OpenShift Cluster | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

Skip to main content

Version: 3.7

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx on a bare metal OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Ensure that your cluster meets all the prerequisites before installing Portworx Enterprise.

The following collection of tasks describes how to install Portworx on a bare metal OpenShift cluster:

- Get Portworx Container Images

- Install NFS Packages for Sharedv4

- Create a monitoring ConfigMap

- Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification

- Install Portworx Operator using OpenShift Console

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify Portworx Pool Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Get Portworx container images​

note

The bootstrap script pulls images that match the CPU architecture of the host machine running it. Run the script on a host that has the same architecture as your destination cluster nodes. For example, if you run the script on an Apple Silicon Mac (arm64) and your destination cluster nodes are x86_64 (amd64), the script will pull arm64 images that are incompatible with your cluster.

-
Set an environment variable for your Kubernetes version:

```

KBVER=$(kubectl version | awk -F'[v+_-]' '/Server/ {print $3}')

```

-
Set an environment variable to specify the latest major version of Portworx:

```

PXVER=<portworx-version>

```

-
Run the following command to download a list of the released images:

```

curl -o images "https://install.portworx.com/$PXVER/images?kbver=$KBVER"

```

-
On an internet-connected host that matches the architecture and OS version of the Kubernetes cluster nodes intended for Portworx installation, download the air-gapped installation bootstrap script for the Kubernetes and Portworx versions:

```

curl -o px-ag-install.sh -L "https://install.portworx.com/$PXVER/air-gapped?kbver=$KBVER"

```

-
Pull the container images for the Kubernetes and Portworx versions:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh pull

```

-
Log in to Docker:

```

docker login <your-private-registry>

```

-
Push the container images to a private registry that is accessible to your air-gapped nodes. Do not include `http://` in your private registry path:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh push <your-registry-path>

```

For example:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh push myregistry.net:5443

```

Example for pushing image to a specific repo:

```

sh px-ag-install.sh push myregistry.net:5443/px-images

```

### Create a version manifest ConfigMap for the Portworx Operator​

-
Download the Portworx version manifest:

```

curl -o versions.yaml "https://install.portworx.com/$PXVER/version?kbver=$KBVER&opver=<operator-version>"

```

Replace `<operator-version>` with the Operator version you want to use.

-
(Optional) If your installation uses images from multiple custom registries, update the version manifest with the custom registry location details. You can use a DNS hostname and domain, or IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6), to specify the container registry server in the following format:

```

<dns-host.domain or IPv4 or IPv6>[:<port>]/repository/image:tag

```

The following example demonstrates registries using a custom DNS hostname + domain, IPv4, and IPv6:

```

version: 2.13.3

components:

  stork: custom-registry.acme.org/portworx/backup/stork:23.2.1

  autopilot: 192.168.1.2:5433/tools/autopilot:1.3.7

  nodeWiper: [2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888]:5443/portworx/px-node-wiper:2.13.2

```

note

-
Ensure that the Custom Container Registry Location field in the Customize tab of Portworx Central is empty for any specs you generate in the spec generator.

-
`kubeScheduler`, `kubeControllerManager`, and `pause` may not appear in the version manifest, but you can include them in the `px-version` configmap:

```

...

kubeScheduler: custom-registry.acme.org/k8s/kube-scheduler-amd64:v1.26.4

kubeControllerManager: custom-registry.acme.org/k8s/kube-controller-manager-amd64:v1.26.4

pause: custom-registry.acme.org/k8s/pause:3.1

```

-
Create a configmap from the downloaded or updated version manifest in the namespace `<px-namespace>`, where you deploy Portworx:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> create configmap px-versions --from-file=versions.yaml

```

## Install NFS packages for Sharedv4​

To install the NFS package on your host systems so that Portworx can use the sharedv4 feature, follow these steps:

-
Start the repository container as a standalone service in Docker by running the following command:

```

docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/portworx/px-repo:1.2.0

```

-
Using a browser within your air-gapped environment, navigate to your host IP address where the above docker image is running (For example, `http://<ip-address>:8080`), and follow the instructions for your Linux distribution provided by the container to configure your host to use the package repository service, and install the NFS packages.

## Create a monitoring ConfigMap​

Enable monitoring for user-defined projects before installing the Portworx Operator. Use the instructions in this section to configure the OpenShift Prometheus deployment to monitor Portworx metrics.

To integrate OpenShift’s monitoring and alerting system with Portworx, create a `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: ConfigMap

metadata:

  name: cluster-monitoring-config

  namespace: openshift-monitoring

data:

  config.yaml: |

    enableUserWorkload: true

```

The `enableUserWorkload` parameter enables monitoring for user-defined projects in the OpenShift cluster. This creates a `prometheus-operated` service in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

## Generate Portworx Enterprise specification​

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your bare metal OpenShift cluster by following these steps.

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In the Portworx Enterprise section, select Generate Cluster Spec.
 The system displays the Generate Spec page.

-
From the Portworx Version dropdown menu, select the Portworx version to install.

-
From the Platform dropdown menu, select DAS/SAN.

-
From the Distribution Name dropdown menu, select OpenShift 4+.

-
(Optional) To customize the configuration options and generate a custom specification, click Customize and perform the following steps:

note

To continue without customizing the default configuration or generating a custom specification, proceed to Step 7.

- Basic tab:

-
To use an existing etcd cluster, do the following:

- Select the Your etcd details option.

- In the field provided, enter the host name or IP and port number. For example, `http://test.com.net:1234`.
 To add another etcd cluster, click the + icon.

note

You can add up to three etcd clusters.

- Select one of the following authentication methods:

- Disable HTTPS – To use HTTP for etcd communication.

- Certificate Auth – To use HTTPS with an SSL certificate.
For more information, see Secure your etcd communication.

- Password Auth – To use HTTPS with username and password authentication.

-
To use an internal Portworx-managed key-value store (kvdb), do the following:

- Select the Built-in option.

- TLS for internal KVDB is enabled, by default. If Cert-Manager is already running in your Kubernetes cluster, deselect the Deploy Cert-Manager for TLS certificates option to avoid installation failures.

-
Click Next.

- Storage tab:

- To enable Portworx to use all available, unused, and unmounted drives on the node, do the following:

- Select the Automatically scan disks option.

- From the Default IO Profile dropdown menu, select Auto.
 This enables Portworx to automatically choose the best I/O profile based on detected workload patterns.

- Select the Use unmounted disks even if they have a partition or filesystem on it. Portworx will never use a drive or partition that is mounted checkbox to use unmounted disks, even if they contain a partition or filesystem.
Portworx will not use any mounted drive or partition.

- To manually specify the drives on the node for Portworx to use, do the following:

- Select the Manually specify disks option.

- In the Drive/Device field, specify the block drive(s) that Portworx uses for data storage.

- In the Pool Label field, assign a custom label in `key:value` format to identify and categorize storage pools.

- (Optional) To designate PX-StoreV1 as the datastore, clear the PX-StoreV2 checkbox.
By default, the system selects PX-StoreV2 as the datastore.

- For PX-StoreV2, in the Metadata Path field, enter a pre-provisioned path for storing the Portworx metadata.
The path must be at least 64 GB in size.

- From the Journal Device dropdown menu, select one of the following:

- None – To use the default journaling setting.

- Auto – To automatically allocate journal devices.

- Custom – To manually enter a journal device path.
Enter the path of the journal device in the Journal Device Path field.

- Skip KVDB device - This checkbox is selected by default and appears only if you choose the Built-in option in the Basic tab.
Keep it selected to use the same device for KVDB and storage I/O. This configuration is suitable for test or development clusters but not recommended for production clusters. For production clusters, clear the checkbox and provide a separate device to store internal KVDB data. This separates KVDB I/O from storage I/O and improves performance.

- KVDB device - Enter the block device path to be used exclusively for KVDB data.
This field appears only if you clear the Skip KVDB device checkbox. The KVDB device must be present on at least three nodes in the cluster to ensure high availability.

note

To restrict Portworx to run internal KVDB only on specific nodes, label those nodes with:

```

kubectl label nodes node1 node2 node3 px/metadata-node=true

```

- Click Next.

- Network tab:

- In the Interface(s) section, do the following:

- Enter the Data Network Interface to be used for data traffic.

- Enter the Management Network Interface to be used for management traffic.

- In the Advanced Settings section, do the following:

- Enter the Starting port for Portworx services.

- Click Next.

- Deployment tab:

-
In the Kubernetes Distribution section, under Are you running on either of these?, select OpenShift 4+.

-
In the Component Settings section:

- Select the Enable Stork checkbox to enable Stork.

- Select the Restrict Data Protection RBAC to restrict RBAC permissions for Stork. You will not be able to use Backup and DR capabilities with this restriction. For more information, see Restrict Data Protection RBAC.

- Select the Enable Monitoring checkbox to enable monitoring of Portworx components and resources.

- To configure the monitoring stack, select one of the following:

- Portworx Managed - To enable Portworx to install and manage Prometheus and Operator automatically.
 Ensure that no other Prometheus Operator instance is already running on the cluster.

- User Managed - To configure and manage your own monitoring stack.

- Select the Enable Autopilot checkbox to enable Portworx Autopilot. For User Managed monitoring stack, Portworx supports the following metrics providers that Autopilot will use to fetch metrics for rule evaluation and automated actions.

- Prometheus - Provide a valid Prometheus URL

- Datadog - Provide a valid Datadog URL, Secret Name and Secret Namespace. To create a Secret, refer to enable Datadog.
 For more information on Autopilot, see Expanding your Storage Pool with Autopilot.

- Select the Enable Telemetry checkbox to enable telemetry in the StorageCluster spec.
For more information, see Enable Pure1 integration for upgrades on bare metal.

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- Select the Secrets Store Type from the dropdown menu to store and manage secure information for features such as CloudSnaps and Encryption.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

-
Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

Status displays `PX is operational` when the cluster is running as expected. If the cluster is using the PX-StoreV2 datastore, the `StorageNode` entries for each node display `Yes(PX-StoreV2)`.

## Verify Portworx pool status​

note

This procedure is applicable for clusters with PX-StoreV2 datastore.

Run the following command to view the Portworx drive configurations for your pod:

```

oc exec <px-pod>  -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl service pool show

```

```

Defaulted container "portworx" out of: portworx, csi-node-driver-registrar

```

The output `Type: PX-StoreV2` ensures that the pod uses the PX-StoreV2 datastore.

## Verify pxctl cluster provision status​

-
Access the Portworx CLI.

-
Run the following command to find the storage cluster:

```

oc -n <px-namespace> get storagecluster
