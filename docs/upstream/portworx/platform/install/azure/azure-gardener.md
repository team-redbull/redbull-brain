Installation on an Azure Gardener Cluster | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

Skip to main content

Version: 3.7

This topic provides instructions for installing Portworx Enterprise on a Gardener cluster running on Azure. Ensure that your cluster meets all the prerequisites before installing Portworx Enterprise.

The following collection of tasks describes how to install Portworx Enterprise on an Azure Gardener cluster:

- Create a Shoot Cluster

- Configure Authentication

- Install Node Packages

- Install Portworx

- Monitor Portworx Nodes

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify Portworx Pool Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx.

## Create a Shoot Cluster​

Use the Gardener dashboard or the Gardener API to create a shoot cluster on Azure. The shoot specification controls the worker node VMs, networking, and the OIDC issuer that Portworx will federate against when using Workload Identity.

-
Sign in to your Gardener dashboard, or set up `kubectl` access to your Gardener landscape.

-
Create a shoot cluster on the `azure` provider. In the shoot specification, ensure the following fields are set:

- `spec.cloudProfile.name: azure`

- `spec.region` — set to the Azure region where Portworx will run.

- `spec.provider.workers` — define the worker pools. Each worker pool's VMs or VM Scale Sets must reside in a single resource group that Portworx will be granted access to.

-
Once the shoot is reconciled, download its `kubeconfig` from the Gardener dashboard or via `kubectl`, and confirm you can reach the cluster:

```

kubectl get nodes

```

-
Note the following values from your shoot. These values are required when you configure the authentication:

- The Azure subscription ID hosting the shoot.

- The resource group that contains the shoot's worker node VMs or VM Scale Sets.

- The OIDC issuer URL of the shoot (only required for Workload Identity).

For more information on shoot creation, see the Gardener documentation.

## Configure Authentication​

Portworx supports two authentication methods on Gardener:

- Azure Service Principal - static credentials (`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`) stored in a Kubernetes secret.

- Azure Workload Identity - federated identity with short-lived tokens injected per-pod by the Azure Workload Identity webhook. For more information, see Workload identity for cloud operations in Portworx.

Choose the method that matches your security and operational requirements.

- Service Principal

- Workload Identity

With Service Principal authentication, Portworx reads static credentials from a Kubernetes secret named `px-azure` and uses them to authenticate to Azure APIs.

-
Log in to Azure and set the subscription where your Gardener cluster runs:

```

az login

az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>

```

-
Create a custom Azure role with the permissions Portworx requires:

```

az role definition create --role-definition '{

"Name": "<your-role-name>",

"Description": "",

"AssignableScopes": [

    "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>"

],

"Actions": [

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/delete",

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/read",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/read"

],

"NotActions": [],

"DataActions": [],

"NotDataActions": []

}'

```

-
Create a service principal for the custom role, scoped to the resource group that contains your shoot's worker node VMs or VM Scale Sets:

```

az ad sp create-for-rbac --role=<your-role-name> \

    --scopes="/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<worker-node-resource-group>"

```

The output includes `appId`, `password`, and `tenant`. Save these values for the next step.

-
Create the `px-azure` Kubernetes secret in the namespace where you install Portworx:

```

kubectl create secret generic -n <px-namespace> px-azure \

    --from-literal=AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant> \

    --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<appId> \

    --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password>

```

Portworx automatically picks up these credentials at startup.

With Workload Identity authentication, Portworx pods exchange a projected service account token for an Azure access token, eliminating the need to store long-lived credentials in the cluster. Before installing Portworx, you must create a user-assigned managed identity, grant it the required Azure permissions, and federate it with the Kubernetes service accounts that Portworx uses.

-
Log in to Azure and set the subscription where your Gardener cluster runs:

```

az login

az account set --subscription <Your-Azure-Subscription-UUID>

```

-
Export the environment variables that the subsequent commands use:

```

export SUBSCRIPTION="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"

export RESOURCE_GROUP="<gardener-worker-resource-group>"

export LOCATION="<azure-location>"

export USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME="<my-managed-identity-name>"

export OIDC_ISSUER="<gardener-shoot-oidc-issuer-url>"

```

note

`RESOURCE_GROUP` must be the same resource group where the Gardener cluster's worker node VMs or VMSS are created. `OIDC_ISSUER` must be set to the OIDC issuer URL of your Gardener shoot cluster.

-
Create a user-assigned managed identity.
Portworx pods use this identity to authenticate to Azure APIs without secrets.

```

az identity create --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \

    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \

    --location "${LOCATION}" \

    --subscription "${SUBSCRIPTION}"

```

-
Save the `clientId` of the managed identity.

```

export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" --query 'clientId' --output tsv)"

```

-
Fetch the `principalId` of the managed identity created in Step 3:

```

export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID="$(az identity show --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query principalId --output tsv)"

```

-
Create a custom Azure role with the permissions required by Portworx, and assign it to the managed identity:

```

az role definition create --role-definition '{

"Name": "<your-role-name>",

"Description": "",

"AssignableScopes": [

    "/subscriptions/<Your-Azure-Subscription-UUID>"

],

"Actions": [

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/delete",

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/read",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/write",

    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/read"

],

"NotActions": [],

"DataActions": [],

"NotDataActions": []

}'

```

```

az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID}" \

    --role "<your-role-name>" \

    --scope "/subscriptions/<Your-Azure-Subscription-UUID>" \

    --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal

```

Replace `<Your-Azure-Subscription-UUID>` with the subscription ID from Step 1.

-
Assign StorageAccount permissions to the managed identity:

```

az role assignment create \

    --assignee-object-id "${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID}" \

    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \

    --scope "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<storage-account-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>" \

    --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal

```

note

You must use this same Azure Storage account when creating the `pxctl` credential for CloudSnap backups. Portworx Enterprise authenticates to this storage account through the managed identity, so the Storage Blob Data Contributor role assignment and the credential must point to the same account.

-
Create federated identity credentials that link the Kubernetes service accounts used by Portworx to the Azure managed identity.
Repeat the following command for each of the `portworx`, `stork`, and `px-node-wiper` service accounts in the namespace where you install Portworx:

```

export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE="<px-namespace>"

export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="portworx"   # repeat for stork and px-node-wiper

export FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME="<my-federated-identity-name>"

az identity federated-credential create \

    --name "${FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME}" \

    --identity-name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \

    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \

    --issuer "${OIDC_ISSUER}" \

    --subject "system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \

    --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange

```

The `portworx` service account is required for Portworx, the `stork` service account is required for Stork, and the `px-node-wiper` service account is required when uninstalling the `StorageCluster` with the `UninstallAndDelete` strategy. Each Portworx component uses a different service account, and Azure requires explicit mapping for each one to establish trust and allow authentication.
For more information, see Azure documentation.

-
Install the Azure Workload Identity mutating webhook on the cluster.
Workload identity does not function without this webhook. The webhook injects the workload identity environment variables, mounts the projected service account token, and enables token exchange with Azure.
For information on how to install the webhook, see Azure AD Workload Identity guide.

-
Verify that the webhook is installed:

```

kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io

```

```

```

## Install Node Packages​

Portworx requires the following operating system packages on every worker node before installation:

- `lvm2`

- `mdadm`

- `parted`

- `augeas-tools`

- `thin-provisioning-tools`

- `dmsetup`

- `nfs-kernel-server`

- `nfs-common`

- `rpcbind`

Portworx does not install operating system packages on Garden Linux worker nodes. If your Gardener cluster uses Garden Linux, ensure that these packages are preinstalled in the worker node image, or provisioned through your supported Gardener or organizational node provisioning process, before you install Portworx. For more information, contact Portworx Support.

## Install Portworx​

You can install Portworx Enterprise on an Azure Gardener cluster either by generating a Kubernetes specification through Portworx Central and applying it, or by deploying the Portworx Helm chart. Choose the installation mode that matches your tooling and operational preferences.

- Generate Specification

- Install using Helm

To install Portworx, you must first generate Kubernetes manifests that you will deploy in your Azure Gardener cluster by following these steps.

-
In the Component Settings section:

- (Optional) Select the Enable Stork checkbox to enable Stork.

- (Optional) Select the Restrict Data Protection RBAC to restrict RBAC permissions for Stork (if enabled) and Operator. You will not be able to use Backup and DR capabilities with this restriction. For more information, see Restrict Data Protection RBAC.

- Select the Enable Monitoring checkbox to enable monitoring of Portworx components and resources.

- To configure the monitoring stack, select one of the following:

- Portworx Managed - To enable Portworx to install and manage Prometheus and Operator automatically.
 Ensure that no other Prometheus Operator instance is already running on the cluster.

- User Managed - To configure and manage your own monitoring stack.

- Select the Enable Autopilot checkbox to enable Portworx Autopilot. For User Managed monitoring stack, Portworx supports the following metrics providers that Autopilot will use to fetch metrics for rule evaluation and automated actions.

- Prometheus - Provide a valid Prometheus URL

- Datadog - Provide a valid Datadog URL, Secret Name and Secret Namespace. To create a Secret, refer to enable Datadog.
 For more information on Autopilot, see Expanding your Storage Pool with Autopilot.

note

This checkbox is available only when you select the Enable Monitoring checkbox.

- (Optional) Select the Enable Telemetry checkbox to enable telemetry in the StorageCluster spec.
For information, see Portworx Telemetry.

- Enter the prefix for the Portworx cluster name in the Cluster Name Prefix field.

- Select the Secrets Store Type from the dropdown menu to store and manage secure information for features such as CloudSnaps and Encryption.

-
In the Identity and Access Management (IAM) section, choose one of the following authentication methods to use for Portworx to access Azure resources.

- Workload Identity (WLI) - To use a federated identity with short-lived tokens injected per-pod by the Azure Workload Identity webhook.
Workload Identity Federation enables the Portworx Operator to configure Portworx components to securely authenticate with cloud services without storing static credentials. For more information, see Workload identity for cloud operations in Portworx.
 When you enable Enable Workload Identity (WLI):

- Select the Enable for Stork (for data protection using Portworx DR or Backup) checkbox to enable workload identity for Stork.
You must select this checkbox to use Portworx Backup or Portworx DR.

- In the Azure Managed Identity Client ID field, enter the `clientId` of the managed identity you created in the Workload Identity tab of Configure Authentication section.

- Service Principal - To use a service principal with static credentials.
 If you selected this option, the spec generator automatically fetches the `px-azure` secret that contains the static credentials (`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`) stored in a Kubernetes secret.

-
In the Environment Variables section, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

note

For deploying Portworx on an Azure Sovereign cloud, specify the value of the `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` variable in the Name and Value fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In the Registry and Image Settings section:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In the Security Settings section, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

#### Deploy Portworx Operator​

Use the Operator specification you generated to deploy the Portworx Operator:

```

kubectl apply -f 'https://install.portworx.com/<version-number>?comp=pxoperator'

```

```

serviceaccount/portworx-operator created

podsecuritypolicy.policy/px-operator created

clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/portworx-operator created

deployment.apps/portworx-operator created

```

#### Deploy StorageCluster​

Apply the `StorageCluster` specification you generated:

```

kubectl apply -f px-storagecluster.yaml

```

```

storagecluster.core.libopenstorage.org/px-cluster-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8dfd338e915b created

```

You can install Portworx Enterprise on Azure Gardener using the Portworx Helm chart. This procedure assumes that Portworx is installed in the `portworx` namespace. If you want to install it in a different namespace, use the `-n <px-namespace>` flag.

-
Add the `portworx/helm` repository to your local Helm repository:

```

helm repo add portworx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/helm/master/stable/

```

```

"portworx" has been added to your repositories

```

-
Verify that the repository has been successfully added:

```

helm repo list

```

```

NAME    	URL

portworx	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/helm/master/stable/

```

-
Create a `px_install_values.yaml` file using the template that matches the authentication method you configured in the Configure Authentication section.

- Service Principal

- Workload Identity

Portworx reads the `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` values from the `px-azure` Kubernetes secret you created. Reference them as environment variables in `px_install_values.yaml`:

```

clusterName: <unique-cluster-name>

provider: azure

drives: type=Premium_LRS,size=150

internalKVDB: true

envs:

  - name: AZURE_TENANT_ID

    valueFrom:

      secretKeyRef:

        name: px-azure

        key: AZURE_TENANT_ID

  - name: AZURE_CLIENT_ID

    valueFrom:

      secretKeyRef:

        name: px-azure

        key: AZURE_CLIENT_ID

  - name: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

    valueFrom:

      secretKeyRef:

        name: px-azure

        key: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

```

With Workload Identity, the Azure Workload Identity webhook injects credentials into Portworx pods based on annotations on the Portworx service accounts. Use the `workloadIdentity.credentials` parameter to instruct the Helm chart to annotate the service accounts with the `clientId` of the user-assigned managed identity you created.

```

clusterName: <unique-cluster-name>

provider: azure

drives: type=Premium_LRS,size=150

internalKVDB: true

workloadIdentity:

  credentials:

    - cloudProvider: azure

      key: azure.workload.identity/client-id

      value: <USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID>

stork:

  enabled: true

  useWorkloadIdentity: true

```

Replace `<USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID>` with the `clientId` of the managed identity you created in the Configure Authentication section. Set `stork.useWorkloadIdentity` to `true` to apply the same workload identity credentials to Stork.

-
(Optional) In many cases, you may want to customize Portworx configurations, such as enabling monitoring or specifying specific storage devices. You can pass the custom configuration to the `px_install_values.yaml` file.

note

- You can refer to the Portworx Helm chart parameters for a list of configurable parameters and the values.yaml file for the configuration file template.

- The default `clusterName` is `mycluster`. However, it is recommended to change it to a unique identifier to avoid conflicts in multi-cluster environments.

-
Install Portworx:

note

To install a specific version of the Helm chart, use the `--version` flag. Example: `helm install <px-release> portworx/portworx --version <helm-chart-version>`.

```

helm install <px-release> portworx/portworx -n portworx -f px_install_values.yaml --debug

```

-
Check the status of your Portworx installation:

```

helm status <px-release> -n portworx

```

```

Note the name of a `px-cluster` pod. You will run pxctl commands from these pods in Verify Portworx Cluster Status.

If you configured Workload Identity authentication, perform the following additional checks:

-
Confirm that Portworx Operator has labeled the Portworx pods:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get pods -l name=portworx --show-labels | grep "azure.workload.identity/use=true"

```

-
Verify that Portworx Operator added the workload identity annotation on the `portworx` service account:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get sa portworx -o yaml

```

The output should include the following annotation:

```

metadata:

annotations:

    azure.workload.identity/client-id: <USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID>

```

-
After the configuration is applied, the Portworx Operator restarts the pods as needed.
Verify that the Portworx pods include the projected token volume, volume mount, and environment variables injected by the Azure Workload Identity webhook:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get pods <px-pod> -o yaml

```

#### Token volume​

```

volumes:

- name: azure-identity-token

projected:

    defaultMode: 420

    sources:

    - serviceAccountToken:

        audience: api://AzureADTokenExchange

        expirationSeconds: 3600

        path: azure-identity-token

```

#### Volume mount​

```

volumeMounts:

- mountPath: /var/run/secrets/azure/tokens

name: azure-identity-token

readOnly: true

```

#### Environment variables​

```

spec:

containers:

- env:

    - name: AZURE_CLIENT_ID

    value: <client-id>

    - name: AZURE_TENANT_ID

    value: <tenant-id>

    - name: AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE

    value: /var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token

    - name: AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST

    value: https://login.microsoftonline.com/

```

The Azure cloud SDK uses these to authenticate with Azure AD and access Azure resources.

## Verify Portworx Cluster Status​

You can find the status of the Portworx cluster by running `pxctl status` from a Portworx pod. Use the pod name you retrieved in Verify Portworx Pod Status:

```

kubectl exec <pod-name> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status

```

`Status: PX is operational` indicates that the cluster is running as expected. If the cluster is using the PX-StoreV2 datastore, the `StorageNode` entries for each node display `Yes(PX-StoreV2)`.

## Verify Portworx Pool Status​

note

This procedure is applicable for clusters with the PX-StoreV2 datastore.

Run the following command to view the Portworx drive configuration for your pod:

```

kubectl exec <px-pod> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl service pool show

```

The output `Type: PX-StoreV2` confirms that the pod uses the PX-StoreV2 datastore.

## Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status​

-
Run the following command to find the storage cluster:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get storagecluster

```

The status must display the cluster as `Online`.

-
Run the following command to find the storage nodes:

```

kubectl -n <px-namespace> get storagenodes

```

The status must display the nodes as `Online`.

-
Verify the Portworx cluster provision status by running the following command. Specify the pod name you retrieved in Verify Portworx Pod Status:

```

kubectl exec <px-pod> -n <px-namespace> -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cluster provision-status

```

## What to do next​

- Create a PVC. For more information, see Create your first PVC.

- You can enable disk locking on Azure disks to prevent accidental or external deletion of the disks. For more information, see Azure Disk Locking.
