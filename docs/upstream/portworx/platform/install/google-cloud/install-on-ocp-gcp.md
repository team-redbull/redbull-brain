The following collection of tasks describe how to install Portworx on an OpenShift GCP cluster:

- Grant the necessary permissions to Portworx

- Create a custom Google IAM role

- Create a Service Account

- Create a secret

- Create a monitoring ConfigMap

- Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification

- Install Portworx Operator using OpenShift Console

- Deploying Portworx using OpenShift Console

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx on OpenShift GCP.

## Grant the necessary permissions to Portworx​

Create the following default roles for Portworx to manage GCP disks:

- Compute Admin / custom IAM role

- Service Account User

### Create a custom Google IAM role​

If you prefer that Portworx has minimal access required, then create a custom IAM role providing the compute permissions. This role allows Portworx to have set of permissions to create, attach, or manage disks on VM instances.

- Create the following `portworx-role.yaml` file with the following minimum permissions:

```

title: "Portworx role"

description: "Portworx role for managed disks"

stage: "GA"

includedPermissions:

- compute.disks.addResourcePolicies

- compute.disks.create

- compute.disks.createSnapshot

- compute.disks.delete

- compute.disks.get

- compute.disks.getIamPolicy

- compute.disks.list

- compute.disks.removeResourcePolicies

- compute.disks.resize

- compute.disks.setIamPolicy

- compute.disks.setLabels

- compute.disks.update

- compute.disks.use

- compute.disks.useReadOnly

- compute.instances.attachDisk

- compute.instances.detachDisk

- compute.instances.get

- compute.nodeGroups.get

- compute.nodeGroups.getIamPolicy

- compute.nodeGroups.list

- compute.zoneOperations.get

- container.clusters.get

```

- Create your custom role for Portworx using the `portworx-role.yaml` file:

```

gcloud iam roles create portworx_role --project=<your-gcp-project> \

--file=portworx-role.yaml

```

 Once you have created the custom IAM role, you need to bind it with a service account using which you can manage GCP disks.

### Create a Service Account​

Create a service account with the appropriate permissions. This account is required to interact with GCP services.

-
Run the following command to create a Service account:

```

gcloud iam service-accounts create <your-service-account-name>

```

-
Grant the required permissions to the Service Account using your custom role created previously:

```

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <your-gcp-project> \

--member="serviceAccount:<your-custom-role>@<your-gcp-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \

--role=projects/<your-gcp-project>/roles/portworx_role

```

This command grants the service account the permissions defined in the `portworx_role` file.

-
Grant your service account the Service account user permissions:

```

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <your-gcp-project> \

--member="serviceAccount:<your-custom-role>@<your-gcp-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \

--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"

```

- Run the following command to get the JSON output of your service account:

```

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gcloud.json \

--iam-account=<your-custom-role>@<your-gcp-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com

```

### Create a secret​

Create a secret called `px-gcloud` in the Portworx namespace (namespace where you will deploy Portworx) using the previously generated JSON file. This will be used for authenticating your service account:

```

oc -n portworx create secret generic px-gcloud --from-file=gcloud.json

```

## Create a monitoring ConfigMap​

Newer OpenShift versions do not support the Portworx Prometheus deployment. As a result, you must enable monitoring for user-defined projects before installing the Portworx Operator. Use the instructions in this section to configure the OpenShift Prometheus deployment to monitor Portworx metrics.

To integrate OpenShift’s monitoring and alerting system with Portworx, create a `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:

```

apiVersion: v1

kind: ConfigMap

metadata:

  name: cluster-monitoring-config

  namespace: openshift-monitoring

data:

  config.yaml: |

    enableUserWorkload: true

```

The `enableUserWorkload` parameter enables monitoring for user-defined projects in the OpenShift cluster. This creates a `prometheus-operated` service in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

## Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification​

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In the Portworx Enterprise section, select Generate Cluster Spec.
 The system displays the Generate Spec page.

-
From the Portworx Version dropdown menu, select the Portworx version to install.

-
In Environment Variables, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In Registry and Image Settings:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In Security Settings, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.

## Install Portworx Operator using OpenShift Console​
