Installation on Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster using Portworx Central | Portworx Enterprise Documentation

This document provides instructions for installing Portworx with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using Portworx Central. Ensure that your cluster meets all the prerequisites before installing Portworx Enterprise.

The following collection of tasks describes how to install Portworx on a GKE cluster:

- Grant the necessary permissions to Portworx

- Create a custom Google IAM role

- Create a ClusterRoleBinding

- Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification

- Deploy Portworx Operator

- Deploy StorageCluster

- Verify Portworx Pod Status

- Verify Portworx Cluster Status

- Verify pxctl Cluster Provision Status

Complete all the tasks to install Portworx on Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Grant the necessary permissions to Portworx​

Portworx requires access to the Google Cloud APIs to provision and manage disks. Ensure that the service account for Portworx has the following roles:

- Compute Admin / custom IAM role

- Service Account User

- Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer

### Create a custom Google IAM role​

If you prefer Portworx to have minimal access, create a custom IAM role providing the compute permissions. This role allows Portworx to have a set of permissions to create, attach, or manage disks on VM instances.

- Create the following `portworx-role.yaml` file with the following minimum permissions:

```

title: "Portworx role"

description: "Portworx role for managed disks"

stage: "GA"

includedPermissions:

- compute.disks.addResourcePolicies

- compute.disks.create

- compute.disks.createSnapshot

- compute.disks.delete

- compute.disks.get

- compute.disks.getIamPolicy

- compute.disks.list

- compute.disks.removeResourcePolicies

- compute.disks.resize

- compute.disks.setIamPolicy

- compute.disks.setLabels

- compute.disks.update

- compute.disks.use

- compute.disks.useReadOnly

- compute.instances.attachDisk

- compute.instances.detachDisk

- compute.instances.get

- compute.nodeGroups.get

- compute.nodeGroups.getIamPolicy

- compute.nodeGroups.list

- compute.zoneOperations.get

- container.clusters.get

```

- Create your custom role for Portworx using the `portworx-role.yaml` file:

```

gcloud iam roles create portworx_role --project=<your-gcp-project> \

--file=portworx-role.yaml

```

 Once you have created the custom IAM role, you need to assign that role to the GKE cluster nodes that will run Portworx.

### Create a ClusterRoleBinding​

Portworx requires a ClusterRoleBinding for your user to deploy the specs. Create a ClusterRoleBinding using the following `kubectl` command:

```

kubectl create clusterrolebinding myname-cluster-admin-binding \

    --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=`gcloud info --format='value(config.account)'`

```

## Generate Portworx Enterprise Specification​

-
Sign in to the Portworx Central console.
 The system displays the Welcome to Portworx Central! page.

-
In Environment Variables, enter name-value pairs in the respective fields.

- For Disaggregated installation you need to set node labels and `ENABLE_ASG_STORAGE_PARTITIONING` environment variable to `true`. For more information, see Deployment planning.

- For restricting Portworx services from listening on all network interfaces, set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"`. By default, Portworx services listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). When this environment variable is set to true, each service listens only on its management IP, data IP or local loopbacks as required. If you do not set `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` to `"true"` during spec generation, you can add it later to the StorageCluster spec as an environment variable.

note

- When you update `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` in StorageCluster, it triggers a rolling update of the cluster. This causes Portworx to restart on each node and it comes up with the new network configuration. We recommend making this change during a planned maintenance window.

- You cannot switch the IP address family (IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to IPv4) using `PX_PREFER_IPV6_NETWORK_IP` while `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS` is set to `"true"`. To switch the IP address family, first disable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`, switch the IP family, and then re-enable `PX_DISABLE_WILDCARD_LISTENERS`.

-
In Registry and Image Settings:

- Enter the Custom Container Registry Location to download the Docker images.

- Enter the Kubernetes Docker Registry Secret that serves as the authentication to access the custom container registry.

- From the Image Pull Policy dropdown menu, select Default, Always, IfNotPresent, or Never.
This policy influences how images are managed on the node and when updates are applied.

-
In Security Settings, select the Enable Authorization checkbox to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure access to storage resources in your cluster.

-
Click Finish.

-
In the summary page, enter a name for the specification in the Spec Name field, and tags in the Spec Tags field.

-
Click Download .yaml to download the yaml file with the customized specification or Save Spec to save the specification.

- Click Save & Download to generate the specification.
