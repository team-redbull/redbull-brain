# MCP Logging

The server supports the MCP logging capability, allowing clients to receive debugging information via structured log messages.

## Server Log Output

By default, server logs (startup messages, errors, debug output) go to **stdout in HTTP mode** and are **silenced in stdio mode** (stdout is reserved for the MCP protocol).

Use `log_file` to redirect server logs to a file, which works in both modes:

```toml
log_level = 2
log_file = "/var/log/kubernetes-mcp-server.log"
```

```bash
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /path/to/config.toml
```

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `log_file` | Path to the log file. Created if it does not exist; opened in append mode (`O_APPEND`). Use the special value `stderr` to route logs to stderr without opening a file. |
| `log_level` | Verbosity level 0-9 (default `0`). Higher values produce more output. See the verbosity reference below for details. |

**Note for stdio mode:** server-side diagnostic logs are silenced by default under the STDIO transport because stdout is the MCP protocol channel. Set `log_file` to a path on disk, or to the special value `stderr` (the [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#stdio) permits stderr in stdio mode), to recover them.

### Verbosity Reference

| Level | What is logged |
|---|---|
| `0` | **Default level** - Critical system errors and failures. |
| `1` | **Level 1** - MCP server configuration reloads, OAuth provider changes, OpenTelemetry initialization, authentication failures, well-known proxy failures. |
| `2` | **Level 2** - Workspace watching/polling, KCP workspace discovery, HTTP request handling, OpenTelemetry sampler selection, OTLP exporter creation. |
| `3` | **Level 3** - Detailed workspace discovery, workspace polling results, KCP client creation failures. |
| `4` | **Level 4** - TLS handshake errors (health checks), JWT client assertion details, OpenTelemetry resource creation. |
| `5` | **Level 5** - HTTP request logging with method, path, status, and duration. |
| `6` | **Level 6** - MCP protocol logging (incoming/outgoing method calls, parameters, results, errors), trace context extraction. |
| `7` | **Level 7** - MCP tool call headers, GetMeta() panic recovery. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Treat `log_file` as a credential when `log_level >= 6`.** Level 6 dumps
> full MCP request/response parameters and results, and level 7 dumps
> tool-call request headers. Tools that accept manifests
> (`resources_create_or_update`, `helm_install`, `apply_resource`, etc.)
> routinely carry `Secret` contents, kubeconfig bytes, OIDC bearer tokens,
> and OAuth refresh tokens — anything that lands in these payloads.
>
> The server applies two layers of redaction before writing:
>
> 1. **Header name denylist** — `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`,
>    `Cookie`, `X-Api-Key`, `X-Auth-Token`, and `Kubernetes-Authorization`
>    are dropped entirely at V(7).
> 2. **Content sanitization** — every V(6) param/result dump and the V(7)
>    header buffer pass through a regex pass that redacts inline
>    `Bearer`/`Basic` credentials, JWTs, JSON `"token"`/`"secret"`/
>    `"password"`/`"api_key"` fields, AWS/GitHub/GitLab/GCP/Azure/OpenAI/
>    Anthropic key shapes, PEM private-key blocks, and DB connection
>    strings (postgres/mysql/mongodb).
>
> Both layers are **best-effort denylists**. Secret material that doesn't
> match a known shape — for example, raw YAML keys in a kubeconfig manifest
> argument, or a custom vendor token format — will pass through unchanged.
>
> Recommended posture: leave `log_level` at `0`–`5` for production, store
> `log_file` on a filesystem with the same access-control posture as your
> kubeconfig, and avoid sharing rotated log files outside of trusted
> incident-response channels.

## For Clients

Clients can control log verbosity by sending a `logging/setLevel` request:

```json
{
  "method": "logging/setLevel",
  "params": { "level": "info" }
}
```

**Available log levels** (in order of increasing severity):
- `debug` - Detailed debugging information
- `info` - General informational messages (default)
- `notice` - Normal but significant events
- `warning` - Warning messages
- `error` - Error conditions
- `critical` - Critical conditions
- `alert` - Action must be taken immediately
- `emergency` - System is unusable

## For Developers

### Automatic Kubernetes Error Logging

Kubernetes API errors returned by tool handlers are **automatically logged** to MCP clients.
When a tool handler returns a `ToolCallResult` with a non-nil error that is a Kubernetes API error (`StatusError`), the server categorizes it and sends an appropriate log message.

This means toolset authors **do not need to call any logging functions** for standard K8s error handling.
Simply return the error in the `ToolCallResult` and the server handles the rest:

```go
ret, err := client.CoreV1().Pods(namespace).Get(ctx, name, metav1.GetOptions{})
if err != nil {
    return api.NewToolCallResult("", fmt.Errorf("failed to get pod: %w", err)), nil
}
```

The following Kubernetes error types are automatically categorized:

| Error Type | Log Level | Message |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Not Found | `info` | Resource not found - it may not exist or may have been deleted |
| Forbidden | `error` | Permission denied - check RBAC permissions for {tool} |
| Unauthorized | `error` | Authentication failed - check cluster credentials |
| Already Exists | `warning` | Resource already exists |
| Invalid | `error` | Invalid resource specification - check resource definition |
| Bad Request | `error` | Invalid request - check parameters |
| Conflict | `error` | Resource conflict - resource may have been modified |
| Timeout | `error` | Request timeout - cluster may be slow or overloaded |
| Server Timeout | `error` | Server timeout - cluster may be slow or overloaded |
| Service Unavailable | `error` | Service unavailable - cluster may be unreachable |
| Too Many Requests | `warning` | Rate limited - too many requests to the cluster |
| Other K8s API errors | `error` | Operation failed - cluster may be unreachable or experiencing issues |

Non-Kubernetes errors (e.g., input validation errors) are **not** logged to MCP clients.

### Manual Logging

For custom messages beyond automatic K8s error handling, use `SendMCPLog` directly:

```go
import "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/mcplog"

mcplog.SendMCPLog(ctx, mcplog.LevelError, "Operation failed - check permissions")
```

## Security

- Authentication failures send generic messages to clients (no security info leaked)
- Sensitive data is automatically redacted before being sent to clients, covering:
  - Generic fields (password, token, secret, api_key, etc.)
  - Authorization headers (Bearer, Basic)
  - Cloud credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - API tokens (GitHub, GitLab, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Cryptographic keys (JWT, SSH, PGP, RSA)
  - Database connection strings (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Uses a dedicated named logger (`logger="mcp"`) for complete separation from server logs
- Server logs (klog) remain detailed and unaffected
