# Configuration Reference

This document is the reference for the Kubernetes MCP Server configuration surface.

Runtime settings live in TOML files. A small set of options also accept environment variables. The CLI is limited to bootstrap knobs that select those files (`--config`, `--config-dir`) plus `--version`. Set `port` in TOML to run HTTP mode.

For release-to-release migrations, see [Configuration Changes](configuration-changes.md). Run `kubernetes-mcp-server --help` for CLI help.

## Configuration Loading

Each option is resolved once per load. Later sources override earlier ones:

1. **Defaults** — Built-in values (for example `list_output = "table"`)
2. **Main configuration file** — `--config`, or `$MCP_CONFIG_PATH` if `--config` is unset. Optional when `--config-dir` supplies the files
3. **`--config-dir` files** — lexical `.toml` files. Can be the only file source. Omitted means no directory is read
4. **Environment variables** — Only where an option declares an env name. An empty or unset variable does not override
5. **CLI** — Only `--config` / `--config-dir` / `--version`. These select files; they are not runtime option overrides

Unknown TOML keys fail the load (startup and SIGHUP exit non-zero). Registered `toolset_configs.<name>` and `cluster_provider_configs.<name>` tables remain valid; unknown fields *inside* a registered block also fail.

String options (including each element of a string list, and duration strings) have surrounding whitespace stripped at load from TOML and env. `tls_cert = " /certs/tls.crt "` is the same as `tls_cert = "/certs/tls.crt"`.

After validation (startup and SIGHUP, success or failure) the server logs every option with its resolved value and source (file path, `<Env>`, or `<Default>`). Sensitive values are redacted. Independent validation errors are all reported. On SIGHUP the same dump includes `changed=true` and `previous` when a value differs from the prior config. A failed SIGHUP reload dumps when a config was produced, then the process exits.

Empty `port` (stdio) with `require_oauth = true` fails the load. OAuth is HTTP-only; the default (`port=""`, `require_oauth=false`) still works.

### Usage

```bash
# Use a main configuration file
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml
# or
MCP_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml kubernetes-mcp-server

# Use only drop-in configuration files (no main config)
kubernetes-mcp-server --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d/

# Use both main config and explicit drop-in directory
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml \
                      --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.d/
```

## Drop-in Configuration

`--config-dir` loads every `.toml` file in a directory, in lexical order. It can be the **only** configuration source, or layered on a main `--config` file.

### How Drop-in Files Work

- **Opt-in**: Files under a directory are read only when `--config-dir` is set. A sibling `conf.d/` next to `--config` is not loaded unless you pass `--config-dir`. If that leftover directory still contains `.toml` files (the files the old implicit lookup would have applied), startup and SIGHUP exit until you pass `--config-dir` or remove them.
- **Standalone**: `--config-dir` without `--config` is enough; those files are the whole TOML surface.
- **Relative path**: Relative `--config` and `--config-dir` are resolved against the working directory, independently of each other.
- **File Naming**: Use numeric prefixes to control loading order (e.g., `00-base.toml`, `10-cluster.toml`, `99-override.toml`)
- **File Extension**: Only `.toml` files are processed; dotfiles (starting with `.`) are ignored
- **Partial Configuration**: Drop-in files can contain only a subset of configuration options
- **Merge Behavior**: Values present in a drop-in file override previous values; missing values are preserved. The last file that set a given key is that key's source
- **Unknown keys**: An unknown key in any file fails the entire load

### Example Directory Structure

```
/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d/   # --config-dir alone
├── 00-base.toml
├── 10-toolsets.toml
└── 99-local.toml
```

```bash
kubernetes-mcp-server --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d
```

Or a main file plus a directory:

```
/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/
├── config.toml
└── conf.d/
    ├── 00-base.toml
    ├── 10-toolsets.toml
    └── 99-local.toml
```

```bash
kubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml \
                      --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d
```

### Example Drop-in Files

**`10-toolsets.toml`** - Override only the toolsets:
```toml
toolsets = ["core", "config", "helm", "kubevirt"]
```

**`99-local.toml`** - Local development overrides:
```toml
log_level = 9
read_only = true
```

## Dynamic Configuration Reload

Configuration can be reloaded at runtime by sending a `SIGHUP` signal to the running server process.

**Prerequisite**: SIGHUP reload requires the server to be started with either the `--config` flag or `--config-dir` flag (or both). If neither is specified, SIGHUP signals are ignored.

### How to Reload

```bash
# Find the process ID
ps aux | grep kubernetes-mcp-server

# Send SIGHUP to reload configuration
kill -HUP <pid>

# Or use pkill
pkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server
```

### What Gets Reloaded

SIGHUP re-reads the main file and drop-ins, re-applies environment variables, re-validates, and logs every option again (marking values that changed, with the previous value). Whitespace padding on string values is ignored, so it is not a change.

Reloadable settings take effect immediately (log level, toolsets, OAuth/token-exchange, confirmation rules, most HTTP body/rate-limit settings, and so on). Toolset registries are rebuilt.

If the new files fail to parse (including unknown keys), a non-reloadable option would change, or Validate fails, the process exits. When Validate fails, the rejected configuration is dumped first. `toolset_configs` parsers see the `require_tls` value from this load; a would-be `require_tls` change fails before those parsers run.

### What Requires a Restart

A SIGHUP that would change a non-reloadable option is rejected and the process exits. Restart to apply those values. That includes:

- Listen/TLS: `port`, `bind_address`, `metrics_port`, `tls_cert`, `tls_key`, `require_tls`, `tls_min_version`, `tls_cipher_suites`, `http.read_header_timeout`
- Process shape: `stateless`, `disable_localhost_protection`, `server_instructions`, `apps_enabled`
- Cluster connection: `kubeconfig`, `cluster_provider_strategy`, `cluster_provider_configs`
- Kubernetes client: `kube_client_qps`, `kube_client_burst`, watcher/poll timings
- Telemetry: the `[telemetry]` table

SIGHUP is not available on Windows; restart the process.

## Configuration Reference

### Server Settings

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `log_level` | integer | `0` | Logging verbosity level (0-9). Higher values produce more verbose output. Similar to [kubectl logging levels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging). |
| `log_file` | string | `""` | Path to a server log file. Required for logging in stdio mode (where stdout is reserved for the MCP protocol); replaces stdout logging in HTTP mode. The file is created if it does not exist and opened in append mode (`O_APPEND`, `0o600`). Use the special value `stderr` to route logs to stderr without opening a file. |
| `port` | string | `""` | When set, starts the MCP server in HTTP mode (Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`) on the specified port. |
| `bind_address` | string | `"0.0.0.0"` | Address to bind the HTTP server to. Set to `127.0.0.1` to restrict to localhost. A warning is logged when listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0` or `::`) without TLS or OAuth, and when a separate metrics port is bound to all interfaces (the metrics server never uses TLS or OAuth). |
| `metrics_port` | string | `""` | When set (in HTTP mode), starts a separate HTTP server on this port serving only `/metrics`, `/stats`, and `/healthz` endpoints. Useful for Kubernetes deployments with network policies to separate metrics scraping from MCP protocol access. The metrics server uses the same `bind_address` but does not use TLS or OAuth. A warning is logged if `bind_address` is all interfaces (`0.0.0.0` or `::`). |
| `list_output` | string | `"table"` | Output format for resource list operations. Valid values: `yaml`, `table`. |
| `apps_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enables MCP Apps resources and interactive views for tools that support them. Requires server restart. |
| `stateless` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, disables tool and prompt change notifications. Useful for container deployments, load balancing, and serverless environments. |
| `disable_localhost_protection` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, disables the MCP Go SDK DNS-rebinding check on Streamable HTTP. Leave `false` for local HTTP. Set `true` only behind a trusted reverse proxy that forwards to loopback while preserving the public or Service `Host`. For that sidecar pattern, also set `bind_address = "127.0.0.1"` (see below). |
| `tls_cert` | string | `""` | Path to TLS certificate file for HTTPS. When set along with `tls_key`, the server serves HTTPS instead of HTTP. |
| `tls_key` | string | `""` | Path to TLS private key file for HTTPS. Must be set together with `tls_cert`. |
| `require_tls` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, enforces TLS for all connections. Server refuses to start without TLS certificates, and outbound connections to non-HTTPS endpoints (e.g., Kiali) are rejected. |
| `tls_min_version` | string | `""` | Minimum TLS version (e.g., `"1.2"`, `"1.3"`; `"1.0"` and `"1.1"` are accepted for operator parity but not recommended). Defaults to TLS 1.2 if not set. Overridden by `TLS_MIN_VERSION` when that env var is non-empty. Applies to inbound HTTPS and outbound clients (Kiali, NetObserv, OAuth, token exchange, well-known metadata). |
| `tls_cipher_suites` | array | `[]` | TLS 1.2 cipher suites (TLS 1.3 cipher suites are not configurable). If empty, Go's defaults are used. Overridden by `TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` (comma-separated) when that env var is non-empty. Applies to inbound HTTPS and outbound clients. |

The Streamable HTTP handler (go-sdk) rejects requests accepted on a loopback address (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`) when `Host` is not localhost. That blocks browser DNS rebinding against a local MCP server. It also 403s the usual in-pod sidecar pattern: kube-rbac-proxy `--upstream=http://127.0.0.1:8080/` keeps `Host: <service>:<port>`. Set `disable_localhost_protection = true` in that case.

For that sidecar deploy, also set `bind_address = "127.0.0.1"` so only the proxy can reach the MCP port. The flag is not what enforces that: default `bind_address` is `0.0.0.0`, and traffic to `podIP:<port>` never hits the Host check (the accept address is not loopback), so other pods can skip kube-rbac-proxy. `metrics_port` uses the same `bind_address`; cluster Prometheus scrapes will fail unless metrics are scraped from a sidecar or you keep a non-loopback bind.

Do not enable `disable_localhost_protection` for a laptop process listening on all interfaces without a trusted proxy. `trust_proxy_headers` does not rewrite `Host` and does not disable this check. Changing the value requires a restart.

**Sidecar (kube-rbac-proxy):**
```toml
port = "8080"
bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
disable_localhost_protection = true
```

**Example:**
```toml
log_level = 2
log_file = "/var/log/kubernetes-mcp-server.log"
port = "8080"
metrics_port = "9090"  # Separate port for metrics/stats (e.g. for network policy isolation)
list_output = "yaml"
stateless = true

# Enable TLS for HTTPS
tls_cert = "/etc/tls/tls.crt"
tls_key = "/etc/tls/tls.key"

# Enforce TLS for all connections (requires tls_cert and tls_key)
require_tls = true

# Global TLS version and cipher suites (inbound + outbound; env vars override)
tls_min_version = "1.2"
tls_cipher_suites = [
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
]
```

**TLS Environment Variables:**

`TLS_MIN_VERSION` and `TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` configure TLS for **both** inbound and outbound connections. They are applied at load time (startup and SIGHUP) and override the corresponding TOML values when set:

| Setting | Inbound (HTTP server) | Outbound (Kiali, NetObserv, OAuth, token exchange, well-known metadata) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tls_min_version` / `tls_cipher_suites` (TOML) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `TLS_MIN_VERSION` / `TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` (env) | ✅ overrides TOML | ✅ overrides TOML |

When neither TOML nor env is set, both inbound and outbound default to TLS 1.2 with Go's default cipher suites.

Inbound TLS is not reloadable: a SIGHUP that would change `tls_min_version` / `tls_cipher_suites` (or their env overrides) is rejected and the process exits. Outbound clients (OAuth, token exchange, well-known metadata) pick up a successfully applied reload; Kiali and NetObserv re-read TLS settings on each tool invocation.

```bash
# Example: Enforce TLS 1.3 minimum version (inbound + outbound)
export TLS_MIN_VERSION="1.3"

# Example: Restrict TLS 1.2 cipher suites (inbound + outbound; TLS 1.3 ciphers are not configurable)
export TLS_MIN_VERSION="1.2"
export TLS_CIPHER_SUITES="TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
```

> **Note:** TLS 1.3 uses a fixed set of cipher suites that cannot be configured. The `TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` setting only affects TLS 1.2 and earlier connections.

> **Note:** When the minimum TLS version is below `"1.3"` and you set a custom cipher list, include at least one HTTP/2-compatible suite (for example, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`). Omitting it can break HTTPS/HTTP2 clients even when TLS 1.2 handshakes succeed.

> **Note:** `TLS_MIN_VERSION` values `"1.0"` and `"1.1"` are accepted for operator parity with cluster-wide TLS settings but are not recommended for production use.

### HTTP Server Security

Configure HTTP server settings to protect against denial-of-service attacks.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `http.read_header_timeout` | duration | `"10s"` | Maximum duration for reading request headers. Primary defense against Slowloris attacks. |
| `http.max_body_bytes` | integer | `16777216` | Maximum size of request body in bytes (default: 16 MB). |
| `http.rate_limit_rps` | float | `0` | Maximum requests per second per session. When `0` (default), rate limiting is disabled. |
| `http.rate_limit_burst` | integer | `0` (effective `10`) | Maximum burst size for rate limiting. Allows short bursts above the rate limit. Only effective when `rate_limit_rps > 0`. `0` uses the built-in burst of 10. |

Duration values use Go duration syntax: `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h30m"`.

**Security Considerations:**
- `read_header_timeout` is the primary defense against Slowloris attacks, which send headers extremely slowly to exhaust server connections
- `max_body_bytes` prevents memory exhaustion from unbounded request payloads. The 16 MB default accommodates large Kubernetes manifests (CRDs, ConfigMaps)
- `rate_limit_rps` prevents any single session from overwhelming the server with requests. Rate limiting is per-session, so one client hitting the limit does not affect other sessions. Requests with no session ID (e.g., STDIO transport) bypass rate limiting.

**Example:**
```toml
[http]
read_header_timeout = "10s"
max_body_bytes = 16777216    # 16 MB
rate_limit_rps = 5           # 5 requests per second per session
rate_limit_burst = 10        # allow bursts of up to 10 requests
```

### Kubernetes Connection

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `kubeconfig` | string | `""` | Path to the Kubernetes configuration file. A non-empty path selects the kubeconfig provider (including from a pod). If empty, client-go uses in-cluster config or `$KUBECONFIG` / `~/.kube/config`. `$KUBECONFIG` is not a server option. |
| `cluster_provider_strategy` | string | auto-detect | How the server finds clusters. Valid values: `kubeconfig`, `in-cluster`, `kcp`, `disabled`. Optional when `kubeconfig` is set. Use this to pin `in-cluster`, `kcp`, `disabled`, or a custom/downstream provider. |

**Example:**
```toml
kubeconfig = "/home/user/.kube/config"
```

#### Client Limits and Watcher Timing

These settings accept both TOML and environment variables. Env vars are integer milliseconds (or numeric QPS/burst); TOML durations use Go duration syntax (`"100ms"`, `"30s"`).

| Field | Type | Default | Env | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-----|-------------|
| `kube_client_qps` | float | `0` (client-go default) | `KUBE_CLIENT_QPS` | Kubernetes client QPS limit. `0` leaves client-go defaults. |
| `kube_client_burst` | integer | `0` (client-go default) | `KUBE_CLIENT_BURST` | Kubernetes client burst. `0` leaves client-go defaults. |
| `kubeconfig_debounce_window` | duration | `"100ms"` | `KUBECONFIG_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | Debounce window for kubeconfig file changes. |
| `cluster_state_poll_interval` | duration | `"30s"` | `CLUSTER_STATE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Poll interval for cluster API discovery changes. |
| `cluster_state_debounce_window` | duration | `"5s"` | `CLUSTER_STATE_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | Debounce window for cluster state reloads. |
| `workspace_poll_interval` | duration | `"60s"` | `WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Poll interval for kcp workspace changes. |
| `workspace_debounce_window` | duration | `"5s"` | `WORKSPACE_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | Debounce window for kcp workspace reloads. |

```toml
kube_client_qps = 50
kube_client_burst = 100
kubeconfig_debounce_window = "50ms"
cluster_state_poll_interval = "10s"
```

None of these take effect on SIGHUP; restart the process.

#### Cross-Cluster Access from a Pod

When the MCP server runs inside a Kubernetes pod, it automatically detects the in-cluster environment and uses the `in-cluster` provider strategy to connect to the **local** cluster's API server.

If you need the server to connect to a **different** cluster instead, set `kubeconfig` to that cluster's kubeconfig file. A non-empty path overrides in-cluster detection; `cluster_provider_strategy` is optional.

**Required configuration:**

```toml
kubeconfig = "/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/kubeconfig"
```

> **Important:** Setting `cluster_provider_strategy = "kubeconfig"` alone (without `kubeconfig`) will fail because the server still detects the in-cluster environment. The explicit kubeconfig path is what overrides that detection.

**Mounting the kubeconfig in a pod:**

A Deployment must run HTTP mode: set `port` in TOML. Empty `port` is stdio, which is for a local client that spawns the process and talks over pipes — not for a pod.

Put `port` and `kubeconfig` in TOML, mount both the config file and the kubeconfig, and expose the HTTP port:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-kubeconfig
  namespace: mcp
type: Opaque

  kubeconfig: <base64-encoded-kubeconfig>

            - --config
            - /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mcp-config
              mountPath: /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml
              subPath: config.toml
              readOnly: true
            - name: external-kubeconfig
              mountPath: /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/kubeconfig

              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: mcp-config
          configMap:
            name: mcp-server-config
        - name: external-kubeconfig
          secret:
            secretName: external-kubeconfig

spec:
  selector:
    app: kubernetes-mcp-server
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: http
```

**Troubleshooting cross-cluster access:**

If the server starts but operations fail (e.g., `failed to list namespaces: unknown`), verify:

1. **Network connectivity** — The pod must be able to reach the external cluster's API server. Check network policies, firewalls, and DNS resolution.
2. **Kubeconfig validity** — Ensure the kubeconfig contains valid credentials (token, client certificate, etc.) and points to the correct API server address.
3. **Permissions** — The credentials in the kubeconfig must have sufficient RBAC permissions on the target cluster.
4. **TLS certificates** — If the external cluster uses a private CA, the CA certificate must be included in the kubeconfig or mounted separately.

### Access Control

Control what operations the MCP server can perform on your Kubernetes cluster. These options help enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring AI assistants only have the permissions they need for their intended tasks.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `read_only` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, only exposes tools annotated with `readOnlyHint=true`. Prevents any write operations on the cluster. |
| `disable_destructive` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, disables tools annotated with `destructiveHint=true` (delete, update operations). Has no effect when `read_only` is `true`. |
| `experimental_enable_target_compatibility_tool_filters` | boolean | `false` | Controls cluster-capability tool filtering. Tools that require API groups absent from the cluster are hidden (for example OpenShift-only `projects_list`, or `pods_top` / `nodes_top` when the Metrics Server API is unavailable). **NOTE:** This feature is experimental, and this option is subject to change or removal in a future release. |

**Example:**
```toml
# Production-safe configuration
read_only = true

# Or allow writes but prevent deletions
disable_destructive = true

# Probe every target for API-group compatibility
experimental_enable_target_compatibility_tool_filters = true
```

### Toolsets

Toolsets group related tools together. Enable only the toolsets you need to reduce context size and improve LLM tool selection accuracy.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `toolsets` | string[] | `["core", "config"]` | List of toolsets to enable. |

**Available Toolsets:**

### Tool Filtering

Fine-grained control over individual tools within enabled toolsets.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled_tools` | string[] | `[]` | Allowlist of specific tools to enable. When set, only these tools are available. |
| `disabled_tools` | string[] | `[]` | Denylist of specific tools to disable. Applied after `enabled_tools`. |

The `configuration_view` tool is disabled by default in HTTP mode because it exposes kubeconfig contents. To expose it in HTTP mode, include `configuration_view` explicitly in `enabled_tools` along with every other tool the server should provide.

**Example:**
```toml
# Only enable specific tools
enabled_tools = ["pods_list", "pods_get", "pods_log"]

# Or disable specific tools from enabled toolsets
disabled_tools = ["resources_delete", "pods_delete"]
```

### Tool Overrides

Customize tool descriptions shown to MCP clients without modifying source code. This enables adding domain-specific guidance to tool descriptions (e.g., "Prefer using label selectors over listing all pods").

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tool_overrides` | map | `{}` | Map of tool name to override configuration. |

**Override Fields:**
- `description` (optional): Custom description for the tool. Empty strings are ignored.

Tools are keyed by their flat name (e.g., `pods_list`, `resources_get`), consistent with `enabled_tools` and `disabled_tools`.

**Example:**
```toml
[tool_overrides.pods_list]
description = "List pods in the cluster. Prefer using label selectors over listing all pods when the namespace has many workloads."

[tool_overrides.resources_get]
description = "Get a Kubernetes resource by name. Always specify the namespace explicitly rather than relying on the default."
```

### Denied Resources

Prevent access to specific Kubernetes resource types.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `denied_resources` | array | `[]` | List of GroupVersionKind objects that should not be accessible. |

**Example:**
```toml
# Deny access to Secrets and ConfigMaps
[[denied_resources]]
group = ""
version = "v1"
kind = "Secret"

[[denied_resources]]
group = ""
version = "v1"
kind = "ConfigMap"

# Deny access to RBAC resources for additional security
[[denied_resources]]
group = "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
version = "v1"
kind = "Role"

[[denied_resources]]
group = "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
version = "v1"
kind = "RoleBinding"

[[denied_resources]]
group = "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
version = "v1"
kind = "ClusterRole"

[[denied_resources]]
group = "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
version = "v1"
kind = "ClusterRoleBinding"
```

### Server Instructions

Provide hints to MCP clients (like Claude Code) about when to use this server's tools. Useful for clients that support **MCP Tool Search**.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `server_instructions` | string | `""` | Instructions for MCP clients on when to use this server. |

**Example:**
```toml
server_instructions = """
Use this server for Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster management tasks including:
- Pods: list, get details, logs, exec commands, delete
- Resources: get, list, create, update, delete any Kubernetes resource
- Namespaces and projects: list, create, switch context
- Nodes: list, view logs, get resource usage statistics
- Events: view cluster events for debugging
- Helm: install, upgrade, uninstall charts and releases
- KubeVirt: create and manage virtual machines
- Cluster config: view and switch kubeconfig contexts
"""
```

### Prompts

Define custom MCP prompts for workflow templates. See [prompts.md](prompts.md) for detailed documentation.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `prompts` | array | List of prompt definitions. |

**Prompt Fields:**
- `name` (required): Unique identifier
- `title` (optional): Human-readable display name
- `description` (required): Brief explanation
- `arguments` (optional): List of parameters
- `messages` (required): Conversation template

**Example:**
```toml
[[prompts]]
name = "check-pod-logs"
title = "Check Pod Logs"
description = "Quick way to check pod logs"

[[prompts.arguments]]
name = "pod_name"
description = "Name of the pod"
required = true

[[prompts.arguments]]
name = "namespace"
description = "Namespace of the pod"
required = false

[[prompts.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "Show me the logs for pod {{pod_name}} in {{namespace}}"

[[prompts.messages]]
role = "assistant"
content = "I'll retrieve and analyze the logs for you."
```

### OAuth and Authorization

Configure OAuth/OIDC authentication for HTTP mode deployments.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `require_oauth` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, requires OAuth authentication for all requests. This **DOES NOT** determine validation strategy, which is done separately by `authorization_url` and `skip_jwt_verification` |
| `oauth_audience` | string | `""` | Valid audience for OAuth tokens (for offline JWT claim validation). |
| `authorization_url` | string | `""` | URL of the OIDC authorization server for token validation and token exchange. |
| `skip_jwt_verification` | boolean | `false` | When true and authorization_url is unset, the server forwards the bearer token without any local validation (no parse, no claims check, no audience check). Required to enable pure passthrough with non-JWT tokens (e.g., OpenShift OAuth sha256~…). When true and authorization_url is set, this flag has no effect — the configured OIDC provider validates tokens normally. Only use the no-authorization_url form when a downstream component (cluster, reverse proxy) is the authority. |
| `disable_dynamic_client_registration` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, disables dynamic client registration in `.well-known` endpoints. |
| `oauth_scopes` | string[] | `[]` | Supported client scopes for the OAuth flow. |
| `token_exchange.strategy` | string | required | Registered token exchange strategy: `rfc8693`, `keycloak-v1`, or `entra-obo`. The block enables global exchange and requires `require_oauth = true`, plus either `token_exchange.token_url` or `authorization_url` to reach a token endpoint. |
| `token_exchange.audience` | string | `""` | Audience for the exchanged token. |
| `token_exchange.scopes` | string[] | `[]` | Scopes for the exchanged token. |
| `token_exchange.subject_token_type` | string | `"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"` | RFC 8693 `subject_token_type`. |
| `token_exchange.requested_token_type` | string | `"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"` | RFC 8693 `requested_token_type`. |
| `token_exchange.token_url` | string | *(falls back to OIDC discovery)* | Explicit token-exchange endpoint. Falls back to the endpoint discovered from `authorization_url` **only when unset** — a set-but-invalid value is rejected at startup, never silently ignored. Use this to point token exchange at a separate STS gateway (cross-realm deployments), or to enable token exchange when no `authorization_url` is configured (e.g., with `skip_jwt_verification=true`). |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.method` | string | none | Required when client credentials are configured: `client_secret_basic`, `client_secret_post`, `private_key_jwt`, or `jwt_file`. May be omitted when only `client_id` is set for a public client. |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.client_id` | string | `""` | OAuth client ID. May be configured without a method or secret for a public client. |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.client_secret` | string | `""` | Required by the client-secret methods. |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.certificate_file` | string | `""` | Certificate PEM required by `private_key_jwt`. |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.private_key_file` | string | `""` | Private-key PEM required by `private_key_jwt`. |
| `token_exchange.client_auth.token_file` | string | `""` | JWT file required by `jwt_file`. |
| `cluster_auth_mode` | string | `""` | Cluster auth mode: `passthrough` (forward Authorization header when present, fall back to kubeconfig when absent) or `kubeconfig` (always use kubeconfig credentials). Defaults to `passthrough`. |
| `certificate_authority` | string | `""` | Path to CA certificate for validating authorization server connections. |
| `server_url` | string | `""` | Public URL of the MCP server (used for OAuth metadata). |
| `trust_proxy_headers` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, honor `X-Forwarded-*` / `X-Real-IP` from a reverse proxy. Leave `false` unless the server is behind a trusted proxy. |

For release-to-release configuration migrations, see [Configuration Changes](configuration-changes.md).

**Example (with client secret):**
```toml
require_oauth = true
authorization_url = "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/mcp"
oauth_audience = "kubernetes-mcp-server"
oauth_scopes = ["openid", "profile"]

[token_exchange]
strategy = "rfc8693"
audience = "kubernetes-api"

[token_exchange.client_auth]
method = "client_secret_basic"
client_id = "mcp-backend"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
```

**Example (with certificate-based auth for Entra ID):**
```toml
require_oauth = true
authorization_url = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0"
oauth_audience = "<CLIENT_ID>"

[token_exchange]
strategy = "entra-obo"
scopes = ["api://<DOWNSTREAM_API>/.default"]

[token_exchange.client_auth]
method = "private_key_jwt"
client_id = "<CLIENT_ID>"
certificate_file = "/path/to/client.crt"
private_key_file = "/path/to/client.key"
```

**Example (separate STS gateway from user-token issuer):**

`authorization_url` validates the user's bearer token; `token_exchange.token_url` is the
distinct gateway that mints the delegated cluster token. The two URLs may point at
different hosts/realms.
```toml
require_oauth     = true
authorization_url = "https://idp.example.com/realms/users"
oauth_audience    = "kubernetes-mcp-server"

[token_exchange]
strategy  = "rfc8693"
audience  = "kubernetes-api"
token_url = "https://sts-gateway.internal/oauth/token"

[token_exchange.client_auth]
method        = "client_secret_post"
client_id     = "mcp-backend"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
```

**Pure token passthrough (delegate validation to the cluster):**
```toml
require_oauth         = true
skip_jwt_verification = true
cluster_auth_mode     = "passthrough"
# authorization_url is not set
```
- The MCP server performs ***no*** token validation in this mode; it only enforces that a bearer header ***is present*** and forwards it to the cluster
- **Security note:** Use this **ONLY** when the cluster (or a trusted upstream component such as a reverse proxy or OIDC sidecar) is configured to validate tokens. Without that, the MCP server is effectively unauthenticated
- `oauth_audience`, `authorization_url`, and other JWT-related options are **ignored** in this mode

For a complete OIDC setup guide, see [KEYCLOAK_OIDC_SETUP.md](KEYCLOAK_OIDC_SETUP.md) or [ENTRA_ID_SETUP.md](ENTRA_ID_SETUP.md).

### Telemetry

Configure OpenTelemetry distributed tracing and metrics. See [OTEL.md](OTEL.md) for detailed documentation.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `telemetry.enabled` | boolean | auto | Explicitly enable/disable telemetry. Auto-enabled when `endpoint` is set. |
| `telemetry.endpoint` | string | `""` | OTLP endpoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4317`). Overridden by `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` when set. |
| `telemetry.protocol` | string | `"grpc"` | OTLP protocol: `grpc` or `http/protobuf`. Overridden by `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` when set. |
| `telemetry.traces_sampler` | string | `""` | Trace sampling strategy. Overridden by `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` when set. |
| `telemetry.traces_sampler_arg` | float | - | Sampling ratio (0.0-1.0) for ratio-based samplers. Overridden by `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` when set. |
| `telemetry.logs_exporter` | string | `""` | OTLP logs exporter. Set to `none` to disable log export. Overridden by `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` when set. |
| `telemetry.metrics_exporter` | string | `""` | OTLP metrics exporter. Set to `none` to disable metrics export. Overridden by `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` when set. |

**Available Samplers:**
- `always_on` - Sample all traces
- `always_off` - Disable tracing
- `traceidratio` - Sample a percentage of traces
- `parentbased_always_on` - Respect parent span, default to always_on
- `parentbased_always_off` - Respect parent span, default to always_off
- `parentbased_traceidratio` - Respect parent span, default to ratio

**Example:**
```toml
[telemetry]
endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
traces_sampler = "traceidratio"
traces_sampler_arg = 0.1  # 10% sampling
```

### Validation

Pre-execution validation catches errors before they reach the Kubernetes API, providing clearer error messages for issues like typos in resource names, invalid fields, and missing permissions.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `validation_enabled` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, enables schema validation and RBAC pre-checks for all API requests. Resource existence is always checked regardless of this setting. |

When enabled, the validation layer runs at the HTTP RoundTripper level, intercepting all Kubernetes API calls (including those from plugins like Helm, KubeVirt, and Kiali). It performs:

- **Schema validation** — Validates resource manifests against the cluster's OpenAPI schema for create/update operations
- **RBAC pre-checks** — Verifies permissions using `SelfSubjectAccessReview` before attempting operations

Resource existence validation (catching typos like "Deploymnt" instead of "Deployment") runs as part of access control regardless of this setting.

For detailed information about the validation flow, error codes, and behavior, see the [validation specification](specs/validation.md).

**Example:**
```toml
validation_enabled = true
```

### Confirmation Rules

Prompt users for confirmation before dangerous actions. Rules operate at two levels:

- **Tool-level** — matches on tool name or `DestructiveHint` annotation. Fires once before the tool handler runs.
- **Kube-level** — matches on Kubernetes API verb, kind, group, version, name, or namespace. Fires per API call during handler execution.

When a client doesn't support elicitation, the `confirmation_fallback` determines behavior: `"allow"` proceeds silently (with a warning log), `"deny"` blocks the action. The default is `"allow"`.

If multiple rules match at the same level, their messages are merged into a single prompt.

| Field | Type | Level | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| `confirmation_fallback` | string | global | Default fallback: `"allow"` or `"deny"` (default: `"allow"`) |
| `tool` | string | tool | Tool name to match (e.g. `"helm_uninstall"`) |
| `destructive` | boolean | tool | Match tools with `DestructiveHint` annotation |
| `verb` | string | kube | Kubernetes verb (`"get"`, `"delete"`, `"list"`, etc.) |
| `kind` | string | kube | Resource kind (`"Secret"`, `"Deployment"`, etc.) |
| `group` | string | kube | API group (`"apps"`, `""` for core, etc.) |
| `version` | string | kube | API version (`"v1"`, `"v1beta1"`, etc.) |
| `name` | string | kube | Resource name to match |
| `namespace` | string | kube | Namespace to match |
| `message` | string | both | Message shown in the confirmation prompt |

A rule must be either tool-level or kube-level. It must not mix tool-level fields (`tool`, `destructive`) with kube-level fields (`verb`, `kind`, `group`, `version`, `name`, `namespace`), and must set at least one of these fields.

**Examples:**

```toml
confirmation_fallback = "deny"

# Confirm before uninstalling any Helm release
[[confirmation_rules]]
tool = "helm_uninstall"
message = "This will uninstall a Helm release."

# Confirm all destructive tool operations
[[confirmation_rules]]
destructive = true
message = "Destructive operation."

# Confirm Kubernetes delete calls in kube-system
[[confirmation_rules]]
verb = "delete"
namespace = "kube-system"
message = "Deleting in kube-system."

# Confirm reading Secrets
[[confirmation_rules]]
verb = "get"
kind = "Secret"
message = "Accessing a Secret."
```

### Toolset-Specific Configuration

Some toolsets accept additional configuration via the `toolset_configs` map.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `toolset_configs` | map | Toolset-specific configuration sections. |

**Example (Kiali):**
```toml
[toolset_configs.kiali]
url = "https://kiali.example.com"
token = "your-kiali-token"
```

**Example (Helm):**
```toml
[toolset_configs.helm]
allowed_registries = ["oci://ghcr.io/myorg", "https://charts.example.com"]
storage_driver = "configmap"
```

#### Helm Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `allowed_registries` | string array | Optional list of permitted chart registry URL prefixes. Only `oci://` and `https://` schemes are accepted. |
| `storage_driver` | string | Optional default storage driver for Helm operations. Supported values: `secret` (default) and `configmap`. |

The Helm toolset supports an optional `allowed_registries` allowlist to restrict which registries
`helm_install` can fetch charts from.

**Behavior:**

- `file://` and `http://` chart references are always blocked regardless of configuration.
- When `allowed_registries` is **not configured**, any `oci://` or `https://` chart reference is allowed, as well as non-URL references (e.g. `stable/grafana`) that resolve through Helm's local repository configuration.
- When `allowed_registries` **is configured**, chart references must be URL-based and prefix-match an entry in the list. Non-URL references (local paths, repo/chart names) are rejected.

**Accepted risk:** bare filesystem paths (e.g. `/absolute/path`, `./relative/path`) are not blocked when no allowlist is configured, because they are indistinguishable from Helm repository references at the string level. When the server runs in a container, the blast radius is limited to the container filesystem. To fully restrict chart sources, configure `allowed_registries`.

Refer to individual toolset documentation for available options:
- [Kiali Configuration](KIALI.md)

### Cluster Provider Configuration

Configure cluster provider-specific settings via the `cluster_provider_configs` map.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cluster_provider_configs` | map | Provider-specific configuration sections. |

**Example:**
```toml
[cluster_provider_configs.kcp]
# kcp-specific configuration
```

## Environment Variables

Empty or unset variables are ignored (they do not override TOML or defaults). Non-empty values win over files.

| Variable | TOML key | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `MCP_CONFIG_PATH` | — | Path to the main TOML file. Ignored if `--config` is set. |
| `TLS_MIN_VERSION` | `tls_min_version` | |
| `TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` | `tls_cipher_suites` | Comma-separated list |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `telemetry.endpoint` | |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | `telemetry.protocol` | |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | `telemetry.traces_sampler` | |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | `telemetry.traces_sampler_arg` | |
| `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` | `telemetry.logs_exporter` | Use `none` to disable |
| `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` | `telemetry.metrics_exporter` | Use `none` to disable |
| `KUBE_CLIENT_QPS` | `kube_client_qps` | |
| `KUBE_CLIENT_BURST` | `kube_client_burst` | |
| `KUBECONFIG_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | `kubeconfig_debounce_window` | Integer milliseconds |
| `CLUSTER_STATE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `cluster_state_poll_interval` | Integer milliseconds |
| `CLUSTER_STATE_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | `cluster_state_debounce_window` | Integer milliseconds |
| `WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `workspace_poll_interval` | Integer milliseconds |
| `WORKSPACE_DEBOUNCE_WINDOW_MS` | `workspace_debounce_window` | Integer milliseconds |

`$KUBECONFIG` is still honored by client-go when `kubeconfig` is empty. It is not a server option and is not listed above.

## CLI

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--version` | Print version information and quit |
| `--config` | Path of the main TOML configuration file. Overrides `$MCP_CONFIG_PATH` |
| `--config-dir` | Directory of lexical `.toml` files. Usable alone or with `--config`. Omitted means no drop-ins. Relative paths are resolved against the working directory |

HTTP mode, kubeconfig, toolsets, TLS, OAuth, and the rest of the runtime surface are TOML (and, where listed above, env). There are no runtime flags for those options.
