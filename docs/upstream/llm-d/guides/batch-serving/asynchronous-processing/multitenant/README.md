# Multi-Tenant Async Processing — Quota, Priority & Saturation

An advanced [Async Processor](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async) scenario built on the
[asynchronous-processing](../README.md) guide, across two dimensions — **team × tier** — for one model served by one llm-d Router
`InferencePool`. Each **team** gets a per-team quota (reserved vs. overflow) and a priority **tier**; the
worker pool backs off when the pool saturates (**saturation-aware back-off**), observed through self-hosted
Prometheus + Grafana (or GCP Cloud Monitoring on the Pub/Sub backend).

The scenario is the point; the **message queue is a pluggable backend** — it runs unchanged on **Redis
SortedSet** (the default here) or **GCP Pub/Sub**. The gate configuration, worker pools, and scenario
walkthroughs are identical across both; only the queue wiring and how you publish differ.

![Animated architecture: three team/tier lanes flow through a reserved/overflow quota gate and the tier-priority merge into one llm-d-async worker pool, which dispatches to one llm-d Router and InferencePool in front of one vLLM model server; as the pool saturates, the worker pool parks](diagram/architecture.gif)

## Overview

The demo serves **one model** (`Qwen/Qwen3-32B`) behind **one llm-d Router and `InferencePool`** (`llm-d-router`).
Three teams contend for it by **tier** and **quota** through **3 queues** and **one worker pool** in
`llm-d-async`:

| Worker Pool | Team | Queue (Redis) | Tier | Reserved quota |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`teams`** (16 workers) | premium | `team-premium` | `interactive` | concurrency **2** |
| | standard | `team-standard` | `async` | concurrency **2** |
| | batch | `team-batch` | `batch` | concurrency **1** |

> [!NOTE]
> **One llm-d-async, many InferencePools.** This walkthrough uses one model and one pool to stay small, but one
> `llm-d-async` deployment can feed many `InferencePool`s independently. Give each pool its own worker pool
> (`workerPools[].id`) and its own queues, with `igw_base_url` pointing at that pool's llm-d Router. Worker
> concurrency, quota counters (use a distinct quota `prefix` per pool) and saturation gates are all per worker
> pool, so saturating one `InferencePool` parks only the workers that feed it. Each pool also needs its own set
> of `InferenceObjective`s (see [step 2](#2-configure-llm-d-router-and-apply-inferenceobjectives)).

How requests are classified:

- **Queue as the serving dimension (tier).** A queue represents a **serving tier**
  (e.g., interactive latency-sensitive, standard async, or batch throughput), **not a rigid single-tenant silo**.
  In production, multiple distinct teams can publish into the **same queue** concurrently. The request payload
  identifies the team via `metadata.team`.
- **Team → reservation classification.** The per-team **`redis-quota`** gate runs in **`classifying`**
  mode (keyed dynamically on `metadata.team`, as `quota:team:<team>`):
  each team maintains its own independent concurrency counter in Redis. When multiple teams share a serving queue,
  one team exceeding its quota does not exhaust another team's budget: within quota → `reserved` (org-guaranteed),
  over quota → `overflow` (admitted and deprioritized, **not** nacked).
- **Tier → priority.** A per-queue `tier` label: `interactive` (premium tier) > `async` (standard tier) > `batch`.

The [**tier-priority merge policy**](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async/pull/294) runs
**per worker pool**: it buckets requests into **6 strict lanes** by
`(classification, tier)`, dispatches them in order, and stamps **`x-llm-d-inference-objective`** via `lane_objectives`.

By defining matching [`InferenceObjective`](#2-configure-llm-d-router-and-apply-inferenceobjectives)
resources in the cluster, `llm-d-async` and llm-d Router Flow Control speak the exact same language.
Requests carry the authoritative objective and tenant identity (`x-llm-d-inference-fairness-id`), allowing
llm-d Router to enforce multi-tenant fairness and priority band admission:

| Lane | Objective (`lane_objectives`) | Header `x-llm-d-inference-objective` | Router Band Priority | Who |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| reserved + interactive | `reserved-interactive` | `reserved-interactive` | 100 | premium within quota |
| reserved + async | `reserved-async` | `reserved-async` | 60 | standard within quota |
| reserved + batch | `reserved-batch` | `reserved-batch` | 30 | batch within quota |
| overflow + interactive | `overflow-interactive` | `overflow-interactive` | 10 | premium over quota |
| overflow + async | `overflow-async` | `overflow-async` | -5 | standard over quota |
| overflow + batch | `overflow-batch` | `overflow-batch` | -10 | batch over quota |

So **all reserved traffic drains before any overflow** (org priority), tier-ordered within each class.
On Redis SortedSet, within a lane dispatch
is earliest-deadline-first (the deadline is the sorted-set score).

### Priority Values: Flow Control ON vs. Flow Control OFF

Downstream priority is propagated via lane objective stamping (**`x-llm-d-inference-objective`**), which maps each request to a Kubernetes [`InferenceObjective`](#2-configure-llm-d-router-and-apply-inferenceobjectives) resource where **higher numerical values represent higher scheduling priority** (100 down to -10).

#### With Flow Control ON (llm-d Router)

When llm-d Router is deployed with Flow Control enabled (`featureGates: [flowControl]` in the router values under `values/router/`):

- **Centralized Priority Bands:** When model server capacity saturates (detected in real time via `concurrency-detector` or `utilization-detector`), requests are held in memory across priority bands matching the `InferenceObjective` priority (100, 60, 30, 10, -5, -10).
- **Strict Band Dispatch:** llm-d router drains highest-priority bands first: all `reserved` bands (100, 60, 30) dispatch before any `overflow` band (10, -5, -10) is admitted.
- **Band Capacity & Drops on Full Bands:** Each priority band enforces isolated buffer limits via `maxRequests` and `maxBytes`. When a priority band reaches capacity, new incoming requests for that band are **dropped immediately (HTTP 429) regardless of that band's priority**. A high priority level does not grant unbounded buffer capacity; an overloaded priority 100 band drops its own incoming traffic rather than evicting queued requests from other bands.
- **Retries with Backoff in `llm-d-async`:** Requests dropped or rejected by router flow control (e.g., when a priority band is full or during in-flight eviction, returning HTTP 429) are caught by `llm-d-async` and **retried with exponential backoff and jitter** provided the request's deadline has not expired.
- **Multi-Tenant Fairness:** Within any single priority band, the router enforces tenant fairness (`round-robin-fairness-policy` over `x-llm-d-inference-fairness-id`, which is stamped from `metadata.team`). No single tenant can monopolize a priority tier.
- **Order Preservation:** Within each tenant's individual flow, requests dispatch in arrival order (`fcfs-ordering-policy`).
- **Priority Holdback (`priority-holdback-policy`, the default in this guide's `flow-control-holdback.yaml`):** As the pool saturates, each lower priority band is admitted only up to a ceiling below full capacity, so headroom stays free for higher-priority traffic. Nothing already running is cancelled. See [Protecting realtime traffic](#protecting-realtime-traffic).
- **In-Flight Eviction (`enableEviction: true`, experimental, in this guide's `flow-control-evictable.yaml`):** When eviction is enabled for Flow Control, only **negative-priority in-flight requests** (`priority < 0`: `overflow-async` at `-5` and `overflow-batch` at `-10`, lowest priority first) can be canceled and evicted after already being sent to the model server.
  While standard gated dispatch only holds back newly arriving work, in-flight eviction actively reclaims occupied GPU compute and KV cache from sheddable background requests when higher-priority traffic is blocked by pool saturation. Evicted requests are retried by `llm-d-async` and redo their generation. See [Protecting realtime traffic](#protecting-realtime-traffic).
- For detailed architecture, lifecycle, and policy plugins, see the [Flow Control Documentation](https://llm-d.ai/docs/architecture/core/router/epp/flow-control).

#### With Flow Control OFF (Baseline Router with Saturation Detection)

When llm-d Router operates in standard baseline mode (without the `flowControl` feature gate):

- **Pass-Through Scheduling:** The router does not maintain priority band queues or tenant fairness buffers.
- **Immediate Rejection of Sheddable Requests:** When the pool is saturated, **"sheddable" requests (those with negative priority, `priority < 0`: `overflow-async` and `overflow-batch`) are immediately rejected with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)**. All other requests pass directly to the model servers and are scheduled via baseline routing plugins (such as `prefix-cache-scorer` and `queue-scorer`).
- **Retries with Backoff in `llm-d-async`:** Requests dropped or rejected are caught by `llm-d-async` and **retried with exponential backoff and jitter** provided the request's deadline has not expired.
- **Saturation Telemetry:** The router still exposes real-time pool saturation metrics (`llm_d_epp_flow_control_pool_saturation` or vLLM metrics).
- **Upstream Priority & Backpressure in `llm-d-async`:** Priority enforcement shifts entirely **upstream to the Async Processor**:
  - The `tier-priority` merge policy ensures that all `reserved` requests are dequeued and dispatched before `overflow` traffic, and higher tiers dispatch before lower tiers.
  - When downstream saturation is detected via Prometheus, the worker pool gate (`wait-on-refuse` or `tier-priority-admission`) intervenes directly in `llm-d-async` by parking workers in-memory (`ActionWait`), refusing messages (`ActionRefuse`), or dropping them (`ActionDrop`).
  - As a result, model servers remain protected against overload even without router-side priority queuing.

#### With Flow Control OFF (Baseline Router without Saturation Detection)

When saturation detection is disabled (no saturation detector configured in llm-d Router) every request is immediately dispatched to available model servers regardless of its assigned priority value.

### Protecting realtime traffic

When realtime (interactive) requests share an `InferencePool` with `llm-d-async` traffic, priority bands alone
do not keep them fast. Async work fills the pool up to the router's `maxConcurrency` (and, under a backlog,
past it), so a realtime request that arrives at a full pool waits in flow control until an async request
finishes: a full request duration
([measurements](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async/issues/468)). **Either priority holdback or in-flight
eviction is required to protect realtime traffic mixed with `llm-d-async` traffic.** The guide provides one
router values file for each:

| | Priority holdback ([`flow-control-holdback.yaml`](values/router/flow-control-holdback.yaml), default) | In-flight eviction ([`flow-control-evictable.yaml`](values/router/flow-control-evictable.yaml), experimental) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **How** | Admits each lower band only up to a ceiling (here falling from 100 % of capacity for priority 100 to 50 % for `overflow-batch`), keeping headroom free for higher bands | Lets async work fill the pool, then cancels in-flight `overflow-async` / `overflow-batch` requests when a higher-priority request is blocked |
| **Realtime latency** | Protected, as long as the reserved headroom is larger than the router's admission burst (`minCeiling: 0.5`; 0.7 and 0.9 were not enough) | Protected |
| **Async efficiency** | The headroom stays idle while realtime traffic is quiet: async throughput was 26 % lower (48 % with shared prompt prefixes) | Full async throughput while realtime is quiet; evicted requests are retried and their partial work is lost (6 to 9 % of the tokens processed) |
| **Maturity** | `priority-holdback-policy` is an Alpha plugin (the values file sets `--allow-experimental-plugins`) | Experimental |

The tradeoff with holdback is between protecting realtime traffic and async efficiency: a lower `minCeiling`
reserves more headroom, which protects realtime traffic against larger admission bursts but leaves more
capacity idle when realtime traffic is quiet; a higher one does the opposite. The figures above come from
[llm-d-async#468](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async/issues/468) (Qwen3-8B on one L4 and Qwen3-32B on two
H100s, router capacity 10); measure your own traffic before tuning.

> [!NOTE]
> **Over-quota is deprioritized, not dropped.** In `classifying` mode, requests beyond a team's
> reserved quota become `overflow` and are dispatched after all `reserved` traffic, rather than
> nacked/redelivered. To hard-throttle instead, set `gate_params.gating_mode: blocking` (over-quota
> returns to the queue; backlog grows).

## Prerequisites

This guide layers on the base [asynchronous-processing](../README.md) guide — complete its
[Prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites) first (through the
[optimized-baseline](../../../optimized-baseline/README.md) guide they cover the client tools, the cluster,
the GAIE CRDs and the HF-token secret), source [`guides/env.sh`](../../../env.sh), then add the following.

- **llm-d router with Flow Control.** This guide uses llm-d Router configured with **Flow Control**
  enabled rather than the standard baseline router. Flow Control assigns incoming requests to priority bands
  based on the `InferenceObjective` CRD referenced by each request.

- **InferenceObjective CRD and Resources.** Requests dispatched by `llm-d-async` carry the
  `x-llm-d-inference-objective` header matching the request's priority lane. You must install the
  `InferenceObjective` CRD and define the objective resources in your cluster matching your `InferencePool`.

- **Hardware.** The default model server is one replica of `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` with tensor parallelism 2: two
  NVIDIA GPUs with 80 GB of memory each (for example H100 or A100 80GB), and a node with 8 CPUs and 96 GiB of
  memory free for the pod. On a single GPU (for example one L4), use the
  [single-GPU override](#1-install-crds-and-deploy-the-backend-model-server), which serves `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` instead.

- **Model Serving Stack & Router.** The walkthrough deploys a single llm-d Router instance (which creates
  the llm-d Router InferencePool) and a single vLLM model server serving `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` on two GPUs (tensor
  parallelism 2).

- **Environment.** In addition to the base guide's variables:

  ```bash
  export REPO_ROOT=$(realpath $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))
  source ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/env.sh
  export MT=${REPO_ROOT}/guides/batch-serving/asynchronous-processing/multitenant

  export NAMESPACE=llm-d-async
  export GUIDE_NAME=async-multitenant  # constant: the llm-d.ai/guide label the router values and PodMonitor select on
  export ASYNC_VERSION=v0.10.0         # llm-d-async release (supports lane_objectives & tier-priority)
  export INFRA_PROVIDER=base           # optimized-baseline model server variant: base, or gke on GKE

  export POOL_NAME=llm-d-router        # InferencePool the router creates (objectives, saturation gates)
  export MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-32B          # served model name (goes in payload.model)

  # Scenario C only: the base URL the saturation gates read PromQL from. The default
  # matches the monitoring setup; override it if your Prometheus lives somewhere else:
  export PROM_URL=http://llmd-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.llm-d-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090

  # Scenario C only: concurrent requests at which the pool counts as saturated.
  # Must be BELOW the worker pool's worker count (16 in the overlays) — see Scenario C:
  export SAT_CAP=4
  ```

## Configuration and Deployment

The value overlays live in [`values/`](values/) with literal placeholders (`NAMESPACE`, `IGW_HOST`,
`POOL_NAME`, `SAT_CAP` in the saturation overlays, `PROM_URL`, `COORDINATOR_IMAGE` in the optional
coordinator manifest, `POOL_NAME` in the vLLM PodMonitor, and `PROJECT_ID` on the GCP paths). Render one for your
environment before installing:

```bash
render() {   # render <overlay-path> -> stdout
  sed -e "s/NAMESPACE/${NAMESPACE}/g" -e "s#IGW_HOST#${IP}#g" \
      -e "s/POOL_NAME/${POOL_NAME}/g" \
      -e "s/SAT_CAP/${SAT_CAP:-4}/g" \
      -e "s#PROM_URL#${PROM_URL:-http://llmd-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.llm-d-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090}#g" \
      -e "s#COORDINATOR_IMAGE#${ROUTER_COORDINATOR_IMAGE}:${ROUTER_COORDINATOR_VERSION}#g" \
      -e "s/PROJECT_ID/${PROJECT_ID}/g" "$1"
}
```

`MODEL` is **not** an overlay placeholder — it never appears in a value, only in comments. The served
model name reaches the system through `payload.model`, which the `publish()` helper below fills in from
`${MODEL}`.

### 1. Install CRDs and Deploy the Backend Model Server

Create the namespace and install the `InferenceObjective` CRD:

```bash
kubectl create namespace ${NAMESPACE} --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# ROUTER_RELEASE_URL exported from guides/env.sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/${ROUTER_RELEASE_URL}/manifests.yaml
```

Create the `llm-d-hf-token` secret the model server reads its [Hugging Face token](../../../../helpers/hf-token.md)
from. The model server runs in this guide's namespace, so it needs its own copy even if optimized-baseline's
namespace already has one:

<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip start -->
```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your Hugging Face token>
kubectl create secret generic llm-d-hf-token \
  --from-literal="HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN}" \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```
<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip end -->

Deploy the vLLM model server:

```bash
kubectl kustomize ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/optimized-baseline/modelserver/gpu/vllm/${INFRA_PROVIDER}/ \
  | sed "s/optimized-baseline/${GUIDE_NAME}/g" \
  | yq '(select(.kind == "Deployment") | .spec.replicas) = 1' \
  | kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f -
```

Instead of maintaining its own model server manifests, this guide renders the
[optimized-baseline](../../../optimized-baseline/README.md) guide's GPU vLLM overlay
(`guides/optimized-baseline/modelserver/gpu/vllm/`) as the [flow-control](../../../flow-control/README.md) guide does:
`sed` swaps in this guide's `llm-d.ai/guide` label, `${GUIDE_NAME}`. It is a constant, `async-multitenant`, because both router values files and the vLLM PodMonitor select on that value. The model (`Qwen/Qwen3-32B`, two GPUs
per replica), image, probes and volumes follow that guide. The one change is a single replica instead of optimized-baseline's two: the
router's `maxConcurrency` and the llm-d-async worker pool below are sized so that async work saturates one replica.

<details>
<summary><b>Single GPU</b></summary>

On one GPU, serve `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` with tensor parallelism 1 instead (the setup the guide's
[eviction measurements](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async/issues/468) used). Set the served model name to
match before publishing, because requests carry it in `payload.model`:

<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip start -->
```bash
export MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-8B
kubectl kustomize ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/optimized-baseline/modelserver/gpu/vllm/${INFRA_PROVIDER}/ \
  | sed "s/optimized-baseline/${GUIDE_NAME}/g" \
  | yq '(select(.kind == "Deployment") | .spec.replicas) = 1' \
  | yq '(select(.kind == "Deployment") | .spec.template.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "modelserver")) |= (
      .args[0] = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
      | .args |= map(select(test("^--tensor-parallel-size=") | not)) + ["--tensor-parallel-size=1", "--max-model-len=4000"]
      | .resources.limits."nvidia.com/gpu" = 1 | .resources.requests."nvidia.com/gpu" = 1
      | .resources.limits.cpu = "8" | .resources.requests.cpu = "4"
      | .resources.limits.memory = "40Gi" | .resources.requests.memory = "20Gi")' \
  | kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f -
```
<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip end -->

`--max-model-len=4000` keeps the KV cache within a 24 GB GPU such as an L4. The pods keep optimized-baseline's
`llm-d.ai/model: Qwen3-32B` label, which only identifies the overlay they came from.

</details>

> [!TIP]
> **Prometheus and Grafana:** If you do not already have Prometheus running, deploy the standard stack using the central [Observability Setup Guide](../../../../docs/operations/observability/setup.md) (`${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/observability/install-prometheus-grafana.sh`). On GKE, you can also leverage [Google Managed Prometheus (GMP)](#observability).

### 2. Configure llm-d-router and Apply InferenceObjectives

Deploy llm-d Router configured with Flow Control and priority holdback, and apply the 6 lane `InferenceObjective`s:

```bash
# 1. Apply InferenceObjectives for the 6 tier-priority lanes
render ${MT}/manifests/inferenceobjectives.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# 2. Deploy llm-d-router with Flow Control priority bands and priority holdback
helm upgrade --install llm-d-router \
    ${ROUTER_STANDALONE_CHART} \
    -f ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/router/base.values.yaml \
    -f ${MT}/values/router/flow-control-holdback.yaml \
    -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ROUTER_CHART_VERSION}

# Get router ClusterIP
export IP=$(kubectl get service llm-d-router-epp -n ${NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
```

<details>
<summary><b>Experimental: in-flight eviction instead of priority holdback</b></summary>

To keep full async throughput while realtime traffic is quiet, at the cost of cancelled and retried async
work (see [Protecting realtime traffic](#protecting-realtime-traffic)), install the router with the evictable
values instead:

<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip start -->
```bash
helm upgrade --install llm-d-router \
    ${ROUTER_STANDALONE_CHART} \
    -f ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/router/base.values.yaml \
    -f ${MT}/values/router/flow-control-evictable.yaml \
    -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ROUTER_CHART_VERSION}
```
<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip end -->

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> **One InferencePool per router:** Deploying llm-d Router creates a single `InferencePool` named `llm-d-router`
> (`POOL_NAME`), and `render` binds all 6 `InferenceObjective`s to it. An `InferenceObjective` binds to a single
> `poolRef.name`, and Kubernetes resource names are unique per namespace, so when one `llm-d-async` feeds several
> `InferencePool`s, put each pool and its router in its own namespace and apply
> `manifests/inferenceobjectives.yaml` there with `POOL_NAME` set to that pool.

### 3. Deploy Redis and llm-d-async

The bundled Redis backs both the per-team request queues and the quota counters.

```bash
kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f ${MT}/manifests/redis.yaml

render ${MT}/values/redis/quota-only.yaml > /tmp/mt-redis.yaml
helm install llm-d-async \
    oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/llm-d-async \
    -f /tmp/mt-redis.yaml \
    -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ASYNC_VERSION}

kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get deploy llm-d-async -o yaml | grep transport
# -> --transport=redis-sortedset
```

Queues are just sorted-set keys — no per-team resource creation needed; they appear on first publish.

<details>
<summary><b>GCP Pub/Sub backend</b></summary>

Requires a GCP project with the Pub/Sub API enabled and `gcloud` authenticated. `gcp-setup.sh` creates
the per-team topics + subscriptions, the results topic, and the service account + IAM.

<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip start -->
```bash
export PROJECT_ID=your-project
${MT}/scripts/gcp-setup.sh                       # topics, subscriptions, results topic, SA + IAM
kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f ${MT}/manifests/redis.yaml   # still needed for the quota counters

sed -e "s/NAMESPACE/${NAMESPACE}/g" -e "s#IGW_HOST#${IP}#g" -e "s/PROJECT_ID/${PROJECT_ID}/g" \
    ${MT}/values/pubsub/quota-only.yaml > /tmp/mt-pubsub.yaml
helm install llm-d-async \
    oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/llm-d-async \
    -f /tmp/mt-pubsub.yaml \
    -n ${NAMESPACE} --create-namespace --version ${ASYNC_VERSION}
```
<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip end -->

`gcp-setup.sh` binds the `async-processor` service account to `pubsub.subscriber`, `pubsub.publisher`,
`pubsub.viewer` (the readiness probe's `GetSubscription`) and `monitoring.viewer` (broker backlog). With
Workload Identity, follow the printed binding to map the GSA onto the chart's `llm-d-async` KSA.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> **Configuration Updates & Dynamic Reloading:**
>
> - **Hot-Reloadable Redis Queue Transport:** When running `llm-d-async` with `--transport redis-sortedset`, `--transport-config-file`, and `--transport-config-watch-interval`, changes to the `queues` array (such as adding, updating, or removing queues and quota parameters) are watched and dynamically reloaded at runtime without dropping in-flight requests or requiring pod restarts.
> - **Static Helm Configurations:** When using inline Helm values without watch intervals, or when altering immutable transport settings (such as Redis URL, worker pool concurrency, merge policy, or on the GCP Pub/Sub backend), configuration is read once at pod startup. Apply changes with:
>
>   ```bash
>   kubectl rollout restart deploy/llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE}
>   ```

### 4. (Optional) HTTP front door with the router coordinator

Publishing (below) writes requests straight into Redis. To accept requests over HTTP instead, deploy the
llm-d-router coordinator with its
[`async-broker` step](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/blob/main/docs/coordinator_async_broker.md)
in front of the router. Each request picks a serving mode with the `x-llm-d-async-mode` header and a tenant
with `x-llm-d-tenant`:

| `x-llm-d-async-mode` | Behaviour |
| :-- | :-- |
| `passthrough` | Forwarded live to the router, stamped with the tenant's objective (streaming works as usual) |
| `wait` | Written to an llm-d-async queue; the connection is held until the result is back |
| `enqueue` | Written to an llm-d-async queue; answers `202` with an id, and the result is fetched later from `GET /v1/requests/{id}` |

The coordinator is one more producer of llm-d-async traffic. Its config
([`manifests/coordinator/config.yaml`](manifests/coordinator/config.yaml)) writes queued requests from tenants
`premium`, `standard` and `batch` to the team queues from step 3 (`team-premium`, `team-standard` and
`team-batch`), where they are treated exactly like requests published there directly: same tier, quota gate and
worker pool. Tenant `realtime` is live traffic only, stamped `reserved-interactive` (priority 100) and never
counted against a quota. The llm-d-async values from step 3 need no change: the team queues leave the result
destination to each request, so the coordinator gets its results back while requests published straight to
Redis still land on `results-list`.

The guide's Redis (`manifests/redis.yaml`) starts with keyspace notifications enabled
(`--notify-keyspace-events Kl`), so held `wait` requests wake up as soon as their result lands instead of polling.

```bash
# The coordinator (image and tag from guides/env.sh: ROUTER_COORDINATOR_IMAGE / _VERSION)
render ${MT}/manifests/coordinator/config.yaml > /tmp/coordinator.yaml
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} create configmap llm-d-coordinator-config \
    --from-file=coordinator.yaml=/tmp/coordinator.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
render ${MT}/manifests/coordinator/coordinator.yaml | kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f -
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} rollout status deploy/llm-d-coordinator
```

Try it:

```bash
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} port-forward svc/llm-d-coordinator 8080:8080 &

```

A client that disconnects while its `wait` request is still queued cancels it before dispatch. The coordinator
trusts `x-llm-d-tenant` as sent, like the rest of the llm-d serving path, so put it behind your own authentication when
tenants matter.

## Publishing requests

A request is a JSON body — `id`, `created`, `deadline`, a `payload` (the inference request that is dispatched to llm-d Router), and `metadata.team` (the tenant identifier that the quota gate evaluates).
With the optional coordinator from step 4, HTTP clients can submit requests instead; the rest of this section uses Redis directly.

### Queues as Serving Dimensions vs. Team Identity

- **The Queue is a Serving Dimension:** A queue corresponds to a service tier (e.g., `interactive`), not an isolated single-tenant partition although it is used as such in this demo because each team uses a separate queue.
- **Multiple Teams in One Queue:** Requests from different teams can be published into the **exact same queue**. The team identity is carried per-request inside `metadata.team` (e.g., `team: "marketing"` vs. `team: "engineering"`).
- **Per-Team Quota Accounting:** The `redis-quota` gate dynamically reads `metadata.team` on each request and increments/decrements that specific team's counter (`quota:team:<team>`). If Team A saturates its reserved limit, Team A's excess traffic is deprioritized to `overflow`, while Team B publishing to that same queue continues to receive `reserved` capacity.
- **Fairness ID:** At dispatch, `llm-d-async` stamps `metadata.team` into the `x-llm-d-inference-fairness-id` header so that llm-d Router's Flow Control fairness policy treats tenants equitably during queue contention.

In this demo walkthrough, queues are labeled with team names (e.g. `team-premium`) for clear attribution, but you can pass any team name into `publish <team> [count]`:

```bash
publish() {                                   # publish <team> [count]
  local team=$1 n=${2:-1} ttl=${PUBLISH_TTL:-300} now dl run i pairs=()
  now=$(date +%s); dl=$((now+ttl)); run="${now}-${RANDOM}"
  # The whole batch goes in one exec — ZADD takes any number of score/member pairs. One exec
  # per request trickled `publish batch 100` in over minutes, and the workers drained it as
  # fast as it arrived: no backlog to classify as overflow. The batch shares a score, so
  # ZPopMin breaks ties on the member string — the zero-padded index makes that publish order.
  for i in $(seq 1 "$n"); do
    pairs+=("$dl" "$(printf '{"internal":{},"request_kind":"plain","data":{"id":"%s-%s-%04d","created":%s,"deadline":%s,"payload":{"model":"%s","prompt":"summarize this","max_tokens":64},"metadata":{"team":"%s"}}}' \
      "$team" "$run" "$i" "$now" "$dl" "$MODEL" "$team")")
  done
  kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} exec -i deploy/redis -- redis-cli ZADD "team-${team}" "${pairs[@]}"
}
# e.g.  publish premium 5     # premium team; prints the number enqueued.
#   PUBLISH_TTL=900 publish batch 400   # one deadline covers the batch — raise it if a
#                                       # saturated pool will not drain within 300s.
# Keep the count in the low thousands: every pair travels in the one exec's argv.

### Stress Testing Scripts

Two end-to-end stress testing scripts are provided in [`scripts/`](scripts/) to drive sustained multi-tenant traffic (team × tier) concurrently to test quota, priority lanes, and populate dashboard metrics:

- **GCP Pub/Sub:** [`scripts/stress-test-pubsub.py`](scripts/stress-test-pubsub.py)

  ```bash
  PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID} ${MT}/scripts/stress-test-pubsub.py
  ```

- **Redis SortedSet:** [`scripts/stress-test-redis.py`](scripts/stress-test-redis.py)

  ```bash
  NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE} ${MT}/scripts/stress-test-redis.py
  ```

[`scripts/benchmark-heavy-redis.py`](scripts/benchmark-heavy-redis.py) enqueues 600 requests across the three team
queues and reports how they drain. It reads in-flight and queue-depth gauges from Prometheus at `BENCH_PROM_URL`
(default `http://localhost:9090`, port-forwarded to the central Prometheus automatically), not the in-cluster
`PROM_URL` the gates use:

```bash
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE} ${MT}/scripts/benchmark-heavy-redis.py
```

## Scenarios A & B — reserved vs. overflow

**A. Steady state** — each team within its reserved quota:

```bash
for t in premium standard batch; do publish "$t" 1 & done; wait
```

Every request is within its team's quota, so all are `reserved` and dispatched in tier order
(premium→standard→batch), stamped with their respective lane objectives (`reserved-interactive`, `reserved-async`, `reserved-batch`). Read results from the results list:

```bash
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} exec deploy/redis -- redis-cli LRANGE results-list 0 -1
```

> Each result is JSON with `id`, `payload` (the upstream response body), and `status_code` (the upstream
> HTTP status). Non-HTTP failures carry `status_code: 0` plus `error_code`/`error_message` (e.g.
> `GATE_DROPPED`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`).

**B. Overflow deprioritization** — flood `batch` past its reserved quota (1) while `premium` runs within
quota:

```bash
publish batch   100 &   # far exceeds batch's reserved 1 -> excess is overflow (lane 5)
publish premium 20  &   # premium reserved (lane 0) -> always jumps ahead
wait
```

- **Priority:** batch's first concurrent request stays `reserved` (lane 2); the rest are `overflow`
  (lane 5), dispatched only after all reserved and higher-tier overflow. The per-team counter caps at the
  reserved limit; the excess flows as overflow (not nacked):

  ```bash
  kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} exec deploy/redis -- redis-cli GET quota:team:batch     # <= 1
  kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} exec deploy/redis -- redis-cli GET quota:team:premium   # independent counter
  ```

- **Team isolation:** premium has its own counter, so batch's overload does not use up premium's reserved
  quota — premium's 20 requests finish ahead of batch's overflow.

## Scenario C — priority under saturation

Switch to the saturation overlay (adds the worker pool's `wait-on-refuse(prometheus-query)` gate) after
bringing up [self-hosted Prometheus](#observability), then drive sustained load:

```bash
render ${MT}/values/redis/saturation-prometheus.yaml > /tmp/mt-redis-sat.yaml
grep prometheusURL /tmp/mt-redis-sat.yaml    # must be your Prometheus, not the literal PROM_URL
helm upgrade llm-d-async \
    oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/llm-d-async \
    -f /tmp/mt-redis-sat.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ASYNC_VERSION}
```

**Confirm the gates can reach Prometheus before you read anything into the result.** The gates are
`wait-on-refuse(prometheus-query)` with `"fallback":"1"` — a budget of 1 is a wide-open gate, so an
unreachable Prometheus produces a run that looks perfect and demonstrates nothing.

```bash
# 1. The URL the gates use resolves and answers, from inside the cluster:
kubectl run --rm -i promcheck --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -n ${NAMESPACE} -- \
    curl -sS --max-time 5 "${PROM_URL}/api/v1/query?query=up" | head -c 120
# -> {"status":"success",...}   anything else means the gates are blind

# 2. vLLM is actually being scraped (the metric the gates read):
kubectl run --rm -i promcheck-vllm --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -n ${NAMESPACE} -- \
    curl -sS --max-time 5 --data-urlencode "query=sum(vllm:num_requests_running{inference_pool=\"${POOL_NAME}\"})" \
    "${PROM_URL}/api/v1/query" | head -c 200
# -> a result with a value; an empty "result":[] means the PodMonitor is not matching

# 3. The processor is not silently falling back:
kubectl logs -n ${NAMESPACE} deploy/llm-d-async --tail=200 | grep -i "using fallback value" \
    && echo ">>> gates are on the fallback budget (1 = wide open), not on live metrics"
```

Then drive sustained load:

```bash
publish premium 200 & publish batch 200 &
wait
```

As the `InferencePool` saturates, the budget → 0 and the `teams` workers **park in-memory (`ActionWait`)** —
the pool stops pulling new work without churning the backlog. As capacity frees, the merge policy drains the
highest lanes first. With several `InferencePool`s, each worker pool's gate reads its own pool, so only the
workers feeding the saturated pool park. Query the budget:

```bash
# Assumes the central Prometheus install from Observability below; point this at
# whatever ${PROM_URL} resolves to if your Prometheus lives elsewhere.
kubectl port-forward -n llm-d-monitoring svc/llmd-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9090:9090 &
curl -s localhost:9090/api/v1/query --data-urlencode \
  "query=clamp(1 - sum(vllm:num_requests_running{inference_pool=\"${POOL_NAME}\"})/${SAT_CAP}, 0, 1)"  # budget -> 0

# Parked workers hold their message instead of dispatching, so the pool's in-flight count
# hovers near ${SAT_CAP} instead of climbing to its 16 workers:
curl -s localhost:9090/api/v1/query --data-urlencode \
  "query=sum by (pool_name) (llm_d_async_async_inflight_requests)"
```

**What "saturated" should look like:** under this load the budget reaches **exactly `0`** and stays there in
stretches. If it never reaches 0, the scenario is
not actually happening — nothing parks, and the run still completes and looks healthy. Check `SAT_CAP`
against the sizing rule below before concluding the gate worked.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`SAT_CAP` must be smaller than the pool's `workers`.** `prometheus-query` closes its gate at
> budget `<= 0`, and `clamp(..., 0, 1)` floors the budget at 0 — so the gate closes only once
> `SAT_CAP` requests are running on that model. Scenario C's load is entirely async, so the only
> thing driving that count is the pool's own workers (`16` in the overlays), and a worker
> evaluates the gate while holding a message it has not dispatched yet: at most `workers - 1` of the
> pool's requests are running at that moment. Set `SAT_CAP` at or above `workers` and the budget can
> never reach 0. The default `SAT_CAP=4` leaves margin on two counts: `vllm:num_requests_running`
> counts only requests the model server is actively running, not ones waiting in its queue, and the
> gate reads it through a 15s `PodMonitor` scrape plus `prometheusCacheTTL: 5s`, so the count it acts
> on is up to ~20s behind the pool.
>
> In production the divisor is a capacity number, not a demo knob: size it to the pool's real
> concurrent-request capacity (`ready pods × per-pod concurrency`) and give the pool enough workers
> to reach it. The gate is back-pressure against **all** traffic on the pool — including synchronous
> traffic that does not go through llm-d-async — so there the count is not bounded by this processor's workers.

## Scenario D — tier-priority-admission with prometheus-saturation

An advanced alternative to `wait-on-refuse(prometheus-query)` is the **`tier-priority-admission`** worker pool gate,
paired with **`prometheus-saturation`** as its inner saturation detector.

While `wait-on-refuse` applies a uniform park action to all requests when the pool is saturated, `tier-priority-admission`
issues a **three-way verdict** based on saturation × tier × classification:

| Pool Status | Request Classification & Tier | Gate Verdict | Behavior |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Unsaturated** | Any | `ActionContinue` | Dispatches immediately to llm-d router |
| **Saturated** | `reserved` (any tier) | `ActionWait` | Parks the worker in-memory until capacity frees |
| **Saturated** | `overflow` + `interactive` | `ActionDrop` | Drops immediately with an HTTP 429 payload |
| **Saturated** | `overflow` + `async` / `batch` | `ActionRefuse` | Refuses message and re-enqueues for later delivery |

The configurations are provided in:

- **Redis SortedSet:** [`values/redis/tier-priority-admission.yaml`](values/redis/tier-priority-admission.yaml)
- **GCP Pub/Sub:** [`values/pubsub/tier-priority-admission.yaml`](values/pubsub/tier-priority-admission.yaml)

To deploy on **Redis**:

```bash
render ${MT}/values/redis/tier-priority-admission.yaml > /tmp/mt-tier-priority-admission.yaml
helm upgrade llm-d-async \
    oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/llm-d-async \
    -f /tmp/mt-tier-priority-admission.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ASYNC_VERSION}
# Worker pools ship in a ConfigMap the processor reads at startup; this upgrade changes only the
# pools, so restart the processor to pick up the new gate.
kubectl rollout restart deploy/llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE}
kubectl rollout status deploy/llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

<details>
<summary><b>GCP Pub/Sub deployment</b></summary>

```bash
render ${MT}/values/pubsub/tier-priority-admission.yaml > /tmp/mt-pubsub-tier-priority.yaml

helm upgrade llm-d-async \
    oci://ghcr.io/llm-d/charts/llm-d-async \
    -f /tmp/mt-pubsub-tier-priority.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ASYNC_VERSION}
kubectl rollout restart deploy/llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE}   # pick up the new worker pool gate
kubectl rollout status deploy/llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

</details>

The inner `prometheus-saturation` gate queries the Prometheus server (`${PROM_URL}`) for the metric `llm_d_epp_flow_control_pool_saturation` exported by llm-d Router's EPP `/metrics` endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Router Metrics Scraping:** both router values files under `values/router/` configure `router.monitoring.prometheus.enabled: true`, which automatically deploys `ServiceMonitor/llm-d-router-epp-monitor` when the router chart is installed. This ensures Prometheus actively scrapes `llm_d_epp_flow_control_pool_saturation`. Without this metric in Prometheus, the gate receives empty data and silently falls back to `fallback: 1.0` (budget 1.0, wide open), preventing the gate from ever closing under saturation.

Verify that the metric is being scraped and that the gate evaluates metrics live:

```bash
# 1. Verify Prometheus has scraped the saturation metric from llm-d-router:
curl -s localhost:9090/api/v1/query --data-urlencode \
    "query=llm_d_epp_flow_control_pool_saturation{inference_pool=\"${POOL_NAME}\"}"

# 2. Verify the gate initialized with the inner prometheus-saturation source. Empty output means
#    the processor is still running the previous gate: restart it as above.
kubectl logs -n ${NAMESPACE} deploy/llm-d-async | grep -i "tier-priority-admission"

# 3. Check gate evaluation and verify source availability (must report 1, not 0):
ASYNC_POD_IP=$(kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=llm-d-async -n ${NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.podIP}')
kubectl run curl-prom --rm -i --restart=Never -n ${NAMESPACE} --image=curlimages/curl -- \
    curl -s "http://${ASYNC_POD_IP}:9090/metrics" | grep "async_gate_metric_source_available"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `async_gate_metric_source_available` must be `1`. If it reports `0`, the gate failed to query Prometheus or received no metric samples, causing it to fall back to an open budget (`fallback: 1.0`). A value of `1` confirms that the gate is receiving real live measurements from Prometheus.

## Observability

Self-hosted Prometheus + Grafana works on any cluster and the gates query it in **real time**; it is
the path for the Redis backend. You can leverage the centralized [Observability Setup Guide](../../../../docs/operations/observability/setup.md)
to install the standard Prometheus and Grafana stack:

```bash
# 1. Install standard Prometheus + Grafana stack
${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/observability/install-prometheus-grafana.sh

# 2. Scrape the vLLM model server (llm-d Router EPP is scraped automatically via its Helm chart ServiceMonitor)
render ${MT}/manifests/prometheus-vllm-podmonitor.yaml | kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f -
```

Open Grafana (`admin`/`admin` in the demo values) and run the Scenario-C load; the **Async Processor**
dashboard shows `async_dispatch_budget`, `async_inflight_requests`, `async_gate_decisions_total`, and
`async_broker_backlog{queue_name,pool_name}`. Break panels down by **`pool_name`** (`teams`) for the per-pool view and by **`queue_name`** for the per-team
view.
`async_dispatch_budget` is the **queue** gates' budget (the per-team quota gates), so it says nothing
about the per-pool saturation gates. Those report through `async_gate_metric_value` — the value the
gate last read, i.e. the `clamp(...)` result — against `async_gate_metric_threshold`, which the gate
closes at (`value <= threshold`, and `prometheus-query` pins the threshold to `0`). Both are labelled
by the owning `pool_name`:

```promql
llm_d_async_async_gate_metric_value{pool_name="teams"}       # -> 0 while the pool is parked
llm_d_async_async_gate_metric_threshold{pool_name="teams"}   # -> 0
```

Their absence is itself a signal: the gauges are only written on a **successful** read, so a missing
or frozen `async_gate_metric_value` means the gate is running on its fallback budget. Cross-check
against Prometheus directly as in [Scenario C](#scenario-c--priority-under-saturation).

<details>
<summary><b>GCP Cloud Monitoring (GKE)</b></summary>

<!-- llm-d-cicd:skip start -->
```bash
kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f ${MT}/manifests/gmp-podmonitoring.yaml    # AP metrics -> Cloud Monitoring

The `PodMonitoring` ingests the AP metrics; the dashboards chart request/success rate, in-flight, p95
latency, broker backlog (`llm_d_async_async_broker_backlog`), in-process queue depth (`llm_d_async_async_queue_depth`),
exceeded deadlines, deadline proximity (`llm_d_async_async_deadline_proximity_millis`), and token throughput.
Note that deadline proximity only works when Redis Sorted Set queues are used (`--transport=redis-sortedset`).
The gate-metric panels need an image newer than v0.7.2. GMP / Monarch lags real time ~1–2 min, so gate control
is bang-bang on that timescale; the self-hosted Prometheus path reacts within one scrape.
</details>

## Notes & gotchas

- **Image / version.** The overlays no longer pin an image tag — the image tracks the chart's
  `appVersion`, selected by `--version ${ASYNC_VERSION}`. Use a release whose chart is published to
  `ghcr.io/llm-d/charts` (v0.8.0+).
- **Reserved quota vs. pool size.** Each team's quota is its *reserved* capacity (priority
  lane) in `classifying` mode, not a hard cap — over-quota flows as `overflow`. Keep the **sum** of the
  reserved quotas at or below the worker pool's worker count.
- **Quota counters** are keyed `quota:team:<team>`. When one `llm-d-async` feeds several `InferencePool`s,
  give each pool's queues a distinct quota `prefix` so a team's reserved capacity on one pool is independent
  of its capacity on another.
- **Saturation gate.** The Scenario C overlays use `prometheus-query` over `vllm:num_requests_running`. The
  `prometheus-saturation` gate (Scenario D) instead expects the EPP metric
  `llm_d_epp_flow_control_pool_saturation`.
- **Saturation divisor vs. pool size.** `SAT_CAP` is the concurrency at which the pool counts as
  saturated, and the gate closes only when the budget hits 0 — i.e. only once `SAT_CAP` requests are
  running. Keep it **below** that pool's `workers`, or async load alone can never close the gate; see
  [Scenario C](#scenario-c--priority-under-saturation).
- **An unreachable Prometheus fails open, not closed.** The saturation gates set `"fallback":"1"`, and
  a budget of 1 is a fully open gate. If `PROM_URL` is wrong, or the vLLM `PodMonitor` matches nothing,
  Scenario C completes cleanly and demonstrates nothing — no error, no parked pool. Run the three
  checks in [Scenario C](#scenario-c--priority-under-saturation) before drawing conclusions from a run.
- **Deadline Proximity.** `llm_d_async_async_deadline_proximity_millis` is only supported when using Redis Sorted Set queues (`--transport=redis-sortedset`). Cloud Pub/Sub cannot expose per-item deadlines, so this metric is only emitted on Redis.
