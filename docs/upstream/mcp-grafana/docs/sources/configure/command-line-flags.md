# Command-line flags

The `mcp-grafana` binary accepts flags for transports, tools, TLS, and observability. Run `mcp-grafana --help` for the exact list in your installed build.

## What you'll achieve

You can look up defaults, choose `--disable-*` flags, or configure TLS without reading the source.

## Before you begin

- You need a way to run `mcp-grafana` on your machine—for example, a [release binary](../../set-up/install-the-binary/), [`uvx`](../../set-up/install-with-uvx/), or a [container](../../set-up/install-with-docker/).

## Configure transport and HTTP options

- `-t` / `--transport`: Transport type (`stdio`, `sse`, or `streamable-http`). Default: `stdio`.
- `--address`: Host and port for the SSE or streamable-http server. Default: `localhost:8000`.
- `--base-path`: Base path for the SSE or streamable-http server. With `--base-path /my-base`, SSE is at `/my-base/sse` and streamable-http at `/my-base/mcp`. `/healthz` and `/metrics` are internal-only endpoints for probes and scrapers and always stay at the server root, never under this prefix.
- `--endpoint-path`: HTTP path for the streamable-http MCP endpoint, appended to `--base-path`. Default: `/mcp`.
- `--instructions-append`: Text appended to the server instructions returned to MCP clients on initialize, so every connecting agent sees it.

## Configure HTTP transport security

The SSE and streamable-http transports validate `Host` and `Origin` headers on every route on the MCP listener (`/sse`, `/mcp`, and `/healthz` / `/metrics` when they stay on that listener) to block DNS-rebinding attacks. Stdio transport is unaffected. Side listeners started by `--healthz-address` or `--metrics-address` are not wrapped.

- `--allowed-hosts`: Comma-separated allowlist of `Host` header values. When unset (or when the parsed value is empty — for example, `,,,`), it falls back to loopback variants of `--address` (for example, `localhost:8000`, `127.0.0.1:8000`, `[::1]:8000`). Pass `*` to disable `Host` validation — only safe when a trusted reverse proxy validates `Host`.
- `--allowed-origins`: Comma-separated allowlist of `Origin` header values. Empty by default — any request that carries an `Origin` header is rejected (browsers always send `Origin` for cross-origin requests, and no browser should be calling this server directly). Pass an explicit list to permit browser clients, or `*` to disable the check.

When deploying behind an ingress or reverse proxy that forwards the original `Host`, set `--allowed-hosts` to the expected hostname (for example, `--allowed-hosts mcp.example.com`). Kubernetes `httpGet` liveness/readiness probes send `Host: <pod-ip>:<port>` by default — either set `--allowed-hosts '*'`, override the probe's `host:` field, use a `tcpSocket` probe, or bind `/healthz` on `--healthz-address` (and `/metrics` on `--metrics-address`). Those side listeners are not wrapped by Host/Origin validation.

## Configure caller authentication

The SSE and streamable-http transports can authenticate the **caller** (the MCP client connecting to `mcp-grafana`). This is separate from the credentials the server uses to reach Grafana: it controls _who may invoke the server_, so an unauthenticated client can't borrow the server's Grafana identity or run tools. Stdio is a local pipe and is never affected.

- `--server-auth-token`: Bearer token that callers must present in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Falls back to the `MCP_GRAFANA_SERVER_TOKEN` environment variable. When set, requests without a valid token are rejected with `401` before any tool runs. Prefer the environment variable over the flag so the secret doesn't appear in the process argument list.

### Bind policy

Caller authentication is enforced only when `--server-auth-token` is set. When it isn't, the network transports warn (but still start) on an externally reachable address:

| Transport / bind | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `stdio` | No caller authentication (local pipe). |
| SSE / streamable-http on a loopback address (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) | Caller token optional. |
| SSE / streamable-http on any other address | Starts and logs a **security error** (at the `error` log level, so it isn't suppressed by `--log-level`) unless `--server-auth-token` is set. |

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The permissive default preserves backward compatibility for existing deployments (such as the container's `0.0.0.0` bind). A future major release will make an unauthenticated non-loopback bind a startup error. Set `--server-auth-token` now to require caller authentication and prepare for that change.
{{< /admonition >}}

Bearer authentication only protects the token in transit if the connection is encrypted. Terminate TLS in front of the server, or use [server TLS for streamable-http](../server-tls-streamable-http/), whenever you set `--server-auth-token` on a non-loopback address.

When caller authentication is enabled, the `Authorization` header is reserved for the caller token and is stripped after validation, so it is never forwarded to Grafana. Setting `--server-auth-token` together with `GRAFANA_FORWARD_HEADERS=Authorization` is contradictory and the server refuses to start; remove `Authorization` from `GRAFANA_FORWARD_HEADERS`, or unset the caller token to run in proxy-forwarding mode.

## Select a Grafana URL per request

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
URL overrides let MCP callers select outbound HTTP(S) destinations. An allowlist limits URLs but does not authenticate callers, bind tokens to targets, or enforce network egress policy.

Deploy behind an authenticating proxy that authorizes each caller's target, removes client-supplied `X-Grafana-URL` and Grafana token headers, and supplies the approved URL with its matching token. Restrict outbound access to approved destinations with a network policy, firewall, or egress proxy. These controls matter even with an allowlist.

Without a URL allowlist, a fake request token can cause requests to any reachable HTTP(S) service, including internal and metadata services.
{{< /admonition >}}

On the streamable-http transport, callers can select a Grafana instance for each request. This is disabled by default.

- `--allow-grafana-url-override`: Enable selection through `X-Grafana-URL`. Falls back to `GRAFANA_ALLOW_URL_OVERRIDE` when the flag is not set.
- `--allowed-grafana-urls`: Optional comma-separated list of exact Grafana base URLs that callers may select. Falls back to `GRAFANA_ALLOWED_URLS` when the flag is not set. It requires the enable switch; an explicitly empty flag clears an inherited list.

For a large fleet selected by a proxy, `GRAFANA_ALLOW_URL_OVERRIDE=true` enables selection without listing every instance in `GRAFANA_ALLOWED_URLS`. The deployment controls in the warning above still apply. The proxy must send both `X-Grafana-URL: <target base URL>` and `X-Grafana-Service-Account-Token: <token for that target>` on each MCP request. The deprecated `X-Grafana-API-Key` header also works. The server uses the token from that request and does not send its environment Grafana credentials to a selected target. If caller authentication is configured, the `Authorization` header carries the separate MCP caller token.

Without `--allowed-grafana-urls`, the server logs a security error at startup. Outbound Grafana requests are pinned to the selected base URL, including across redirects. Selection does not work over SSE, which does not pass per-request headers to tool calls; a selected URL there is used without the caller's token, so the calls fail.

## Configure debug and logging

- `--debug`: Enable debug mode for detailed HTTP request and response logging to and from the Grafana API.
- `--log-level`: Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Default: `info`.

## Configure observability endpoints

- `--metrics`: Expose a Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics` (SSE and streamable-http only).
- `--metrics-address`: Optional separate listen address for metrics (for example, `:9090`). If empty, metrics are served on the main HTTP server.
- `--healthz-address`: Optional separate listen address for `/healthz` (for example, `:8080`). If empty, `/healthz` is served on the main HTTP server. If this matches `--metrics-address`, both routes share one extra listener. The side listener is not wrapped by Host/Origin validation, so Kubernetes probes can reach it while `--address` stays on loopback.

## Configure anonymous usage statistics

- `--usage-stats`: Anonymous usage statistics reporting: `enabled`, `disabled`, or `log` to print the report that would be sent to stderr and send nothing. Overrides the `GRAFANA_USAGE_STATS` environment variable. Default: `enabled`.

`GRAFANA_USAGE_STATS_ENDPOINT` changes where reports are sent.

Refer to [Anonymous usage statistics](../../anonymous-usage-statistics/) for the full list of fields, what is never sent, and how to read the data.

## Configure tool categories

- `--enabled-tools`: Comma-separated list of enabled tool **categories**. The default is exactly:

  `search,datasource,incident,prometheus,loki,alerting,dashboard,folder,oncall,asserts,pyroscope,navigation,tempo,annotations,rendering,snapshot,docs`

  Categories **not** in that default string are off until you add them, including: `admin`, `agento11y`, `assistant`, `elasticsearch`, `cloudwatch`, `cloudlogging`, `examples`, `sql`, `influxdb`, `quickwit`, and `runpanelquery`. Pass a full comma-separated list to replace the default entirely, or use `--disable-*` flags to turn off pieces of the default set. Back-compat aliases `clickhouse`, `snowflake`, and `athena` map to `sql`; `proxied` maps to `tempo`.

- `--disable-search`: Disable search tools.
- `--disable-datasource`: Disable datasource tools.
- `--disable-incident`: Disable incident tools.
- `--disable-prometheus`: Disable Prometheus tools.
- `--disable-write`: Disable write tools (read-only mode; refer to the following section).
- `--disable-query`: Disable query tools (tools that execute a query against a datasource; refer to the following section).
- `--enable-query`: Keep the raw-SQL query tools registered under `--disable-write` (refer to the following section).
- `--disable-loki`: Disable Loki tools.
- `--disable-elasticsearch`: Disable Elasticsearch tools.
- `--disable-quickwit`: Disable Quickwit tools.
- `--disable-influxdb`: Disable InfluxDB tools.
- `--disable-alerting`: Disable alerting tools.
- `--disable-dashboard`: Disable dashboard tools.
- `--disable-folder`: Disable folder tools.
- `--disable-oncall`: Disable OnCall tools.
- `--disable-asserts`: Disable Asserts tools.
- `--disable-admin`: Disable admin tools.
- `--disable-pyroscope`: Disable Pyroscope tools.
- `--disable-navigation`: Disable navigation (deeplink) tools.
- `--disable-rendering`: Disable rendering tools (panel or dashboard image export).
- `--disable-snapshot`: Disable snapshot tools.
- `--disable-cloudwatch`: Disable CloudWatch tools.
- `--disable-cloudlogging`: Disable Google Cloud Logging tools.
- `--disable-examples`: Disable query examples tools.
- `--disable-sql`: Disable SQL datasource tools (ClickHouse, Snowflake, Athena, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL). Aliases `--disable-clickhouse`, `--disable-snowflake`, `--disable-athena` also work.
- `--disable-runpanelquery`: Disable run panel query tools.
- `--disable-annotations`: Disable annotation tools.
- `--disable-tempo`: Disable Tempo tracing tools.
- `--disable-provisioning`: Disable provisioning tools.
- `--disable-agento11y`: Disable Agent Observability tools.
- `--disable-assistant`: Disable Grafana Assistant tools.
- `--disable-docs`: Disable documentation tools.
- `--disable-user`: Disable user info tools.

## Configure tool limits

- `--max-loki-log-limit`: Maximum number of log lines returned per `query_loki_logs` call.
- `--loki-guardrail-mode`: Loki query cost guardrail for `query_loki_logs`: `off` (default), `shadow` (log queries that would be blocked, but let them run), or `enforce` (reject them with rewrite guidance). The guardrail requires a selective stream selector, caps the effective time range (including range-vector durations like `[30d]`), and pre-checks Loki's index/stats byte estimate before running the query. On VictoriaLogs it applies only to selector-shaped (`{...}`) queries — brace-less LogsQL passes through entirely and the byte-budget check never applies. Falls back to the `GRAFANA_LOKI_GUARDRAIL_MODE` environment variable.
- `--loki-guardrail-max-bytes`: Maximum bytes a single `query_loki_logs` call may scan, estimated via Loki's index/stats API. Defaults to 100 GiB; `0` disables the byte-budget check. Falls back to `GRAFANA_LOKI_GUARDRAIL_MAX_BYTES`.
- `--loki-guardrail-max-range`: Maximum effective time range for a single `query_loki_logs` call, including range-vector durations. Defaults to `24h`; `0` disables the range check. Falls back to `GRAFANA_LOKI_GUARDRAIL_MAX_RANGE`.

The guardrail's decisions are also exported as OTel counters (`mcp_loki_guardrail_admitted_total`, `_would_block_total`, `_blocked_total`, `_fail_open_total`), which is the recommended way to size the affected population before promoting from `shadow` to `enforce`. See [Observability](../../developer/observability-metrics-and-tracing/#loki-cost-guardrail-metrics).
- `--dynamic-multi-org`: Allow tool calls to select a Grafana organization per call via an optional `orgId` argument. Off by default. See [Multi-organization support](../multi-organization-and-headers/).

## Run without query execution

`--disable-query` removes every tool that executes a query against a datasource, and leaves the metadata and discovery tools in place.

Use it when the assistant should be able to explore what exists — datasources, dashboards, metric names, labels, table schemas — without running potentially expensive or data-revealing queries; for example, with a service account that has `datasources:read` but not `datasources:query`.

The following tools are not registered when the flag is set:

- Prometheus: `query_prometheus`, `query_prometheus_histogram`
- Loki: `query_loki_logs`, `query_loki_patterns` (`query_loki_stats` and `analyze_loki_labels` read the index rather than returning log content, so they stay registered)
- Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, Quickwit: `query_elasticsearch`, `query_quickwit`
- SQL datasources: `query_sql`, `query_influxdb`
- Graphite: `query_graphite`, `query_graphite_density`
- CloudWatch: `query_cloudwatch`
- Google Cloud Logging: `query_cloud_logging`
- Pyroscope: `query_pyroscope`
- Panels: `run_panel_query`

The `elasticsearch`, `quickwit`, `influxdb`, and `runpanelquery` categories contain nothing else, so they expose no tools at all when queries are disabled. Sibling tools such as `list_prometheus_metric_names`, `list_loki_label_values`, `describe_sql_table`, `list_cloudwatch_metrics`, and `list_cloud_logging_projects` remain available.

The flag gates the query tools and the `grafana_api_request` POST-to-`/api/ds/query` path, but doesn't police every route to a datasource. In read-only mode, `grafana_api_request` allows POST to `/api/ds/query` only when query tools are enabled (same gate as the raw-SQL tools — blocked by `--disable-write` unless `--enable-query` overrides). `get_panel_image`, which renders a panel server-side, is unaffected.

### Query execution and read-only mode

The raw-SQL query tools — `query_sql` and `query_influxdb` — send the query to the datasource unfiltered, so they write whenever the datasource credentials permit it. Read-only mode removes them along with the other write tools.

`--enable-query` puts them back. Use it when the datasource credentials are known to be read-only and you want query execution in an otherwise read-only server. It doesn't re-enable any other write tool, and it has no effect alongside `--disable-query`, which always wins.

| Flags | Safe query tools | Raw-SQL query tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _(none)_ | Registered | Registered |
| `--disable-write` | Registered | Not registered |
| `--disable-write --enable-query` | Registered | Registered |
| `--disable-query` | Not registered | Not registered |
| `--disable-query --enable-query` | Not registered | Not registered |

## Restrict which Loki streams can be read

- `--loki-enforced-matchers`: LogQL label matchers AND-ed into every native-Loki query to restrict which log streams can be read (e.g. `environment=~"prod|staging"`). Unparseable queries are rejected; VictoriaLogs datasources are refused while set.
- `--loki-label-enumeration-fallback`: What the label-enumeration tools do when negative enforced matchers can't scope them: `reject` (default) or `unfiltered`.

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
Enforcement applies only to the Loki query tools. Other tools can reach Loki log data through paths that never touch the enforced backend, so you must also disable them for the restriction to hold:

- `--disable-api`: `grafana_api_request` can query the Loki datasource proxy directly (full bypass).
- `--disable-rendering`: `get_panel_image` renders Loki panels server-side, producing images with unrestricted log lines.
- `--disable-assistant`: `ask_assistant` delegates to Grafana Assistant, which reads Loki server-side across all streams. It is only registered when write tools are enabled, so `--disable-write` closes it too.

The server logs a warning at startup naming each of these that is still enabled. `run_panel_query` is safe: it routes on the datasource's real type resolved from its UID, so a Loki datasource always runs through the enforced query path even if the panel or the caller declares a different `datasourceType`. Tempo tools expose only traces, not Loki logs, so they are not a bypass. Dashboard snapshots (`--disable-snapshot`) can embed log-panel data captured outside enforcement.

## Run in read-only mode

`--disable-write` prevents write operations to Grafana. Use it with read-only service accounts, safer production assistants, or to avoid accidental changes. It also removes the raw-SQL query tools, which can write through the datasource; refer to the preceding section for `--enable-query`, which keeps them.

When enabled, the following writes are disabled:

**Dashboard tools**

- `update_dashboard`

**Folder tools**

- `create_folder`

**Incident tools**

- `create_incident`
- `add_activity_to_incident`
- `update_incident`

**Alerting tools**

- `alerting_rules_write` (create, update, delete)
- `alerting_silences_write` (create, update, delete)
- `alerting_routing_write` (create_contact_point)

**OnCall tools**

- `update_alert_group`

**Annotation tools**

- `create_annotation`
- `update_annotation`
- `delete_annotation`

**Snapshot tools**

- `create_snapshot`
- `delete_snapshot`

**Agent Observability tools**

- `agento11y_manage_evaluators` (upsert, delete, fork, and test evaluators)
- `agento11y_manage_eval_rules` (create, update, delete, and preview eval rules and guards)
- `agento11y_manage_eval_collections` (save and delete saved conversations; create, update, and delete collections; add and remove collection members)
- `agento11y_manage_experiments` (update and cancel experiments)
- `agento11y_manage_test_suites` (create and update test suites; create and publish versions; upsert and delete test cases)

Read operations (queries, lists, searches) stay available.

## Configure Grafana HTTP redirects

Outbound Grafana clients block redirects to a different scheme, host, or port by default. Use `--allow-cross-origin-redirects` or set `GRAFANA_ALLOW_CROSS_ORIGIN_REDIRECTS=true` to allow them. The flag takes precedence over the environment variable. Allowing these redirects can send Grafana credentials to the redirect target. Request-selected Grafana URLs remain pinned to their selected target.

## Configure client TLS for Grafana

- `--tls-cert-file`: Client certificate for mTLS to Grafana.
- `--tls-key-file`: Client private key.
- `--tls-ca-file`: CA certificate for verifying Grafana’s server certificate.
- `--tls-skip-verify`: Skip TLS verification (insecure; testing only).

## Configure server TLS for streamable-http

These flags secure the MCP HTTP server (between your MCP client and `mcp-grafana`), not the connection from `mcp-grafana` to Grafana:

- `--server.tls-cert-file`: Server certificate for HTTPS.
- `--server.tls-key-file`: Server private key.

## Print version information

- `--version`: Print the version and exit.
