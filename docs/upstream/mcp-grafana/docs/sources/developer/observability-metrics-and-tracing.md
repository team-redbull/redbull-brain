# Observability (metrics, tracing, and logs)

The MCP server can expose **Prometheus metrics** and supports **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)** distributed tracing and log export, following the [OTel MCP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/).

Metrics require the **SSE** or **streamable-http** transport. Tracing and log export use standard `OTEL_*` environment variables and work with any transport, independently of `--metrics`.

**Note**: mcp-grafana currently only supports the OTLP/gRPC transport for both traces and logs. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` (and its `_TRACES_PROTOCOL` / `_LOGS_PROTOCOL` variants) are not honored — gRPC is used regardless.

## What you'll achieve

You can scrape MCP operation metrics (HTTP transports only) and export traces and logs to Tempo, Loki, or Grafana Cloud under any transport, including stdio.

## Before you begin

- The server running with **SSE** or **streamable-http** (metrics are not available with stdio).

## Enable Prometheus metrics

When using SSE or streamable HTTP transports, enable Prometheus metrics with `--metrics`:

```bash
# Metrics on the main server at /metrics
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http --metrics
```
```bash
# Metrics on a separate listen address
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http --metrics --metrics-address :9090
```

**Available metrics:**

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mcp_server_operation_duration_seconds` | Histogram | MCP operation duration (labels: `mcp_method_name`, `gen_ai_tool_name`, `error_type`, `network_transport`, `mcp_protocol_version`, and — for `tools/call` on selected tools — `mcp_tool_operation`, `mcp_tool_resource_type`, `mcp_tool_phase`) |
| `mcp_server_session_duration_seconds` | Histogram | MCP client session duration (labels: `network_transport`, `mcp_protocol_version`) |
| `http_server_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | HTTP server request duration (from otelhttp) |

**Note**: Metrics are only available when using SSE or streamable HTTP transports. They are **not** available with stdio transport.

### Tool-call dimension labels

For `tools/call`, `mcp_server_operation_duration_seconds` can carry up to three extra low-cardinality labels so durations are sliceable by what the call was doing:

| Label | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `mcp_tool_operation` | the tool's `operation` argument | Multiplexer tools only (e.g. `alerting_rules_write`); one of the tool's declared operations, else `other`. |
| `mcp_tool_resource_type` | the tool's `type` argument | e.g. the datasource plugin type on `create_datasource`; a plugin type the server ships a schema for, else `other`. |
| `mcp_tool_phase` | the tool's result `_meta` | Phase of a multi-call flow (e.g. `create_datasource` schema guidance vs. actual creation). |

Arguments are raw client input, so the two argument-derived labels are allowlisted by tool **and** by value: unlisted tools emit neither, and unlisted values collapse into one `other` bucket, giving each label a fixed maximum series count. Tool validation alone would not bound them — a rejected `operation` is still instrumented, and `create_datasource`'s `type` is free text that succeeds for unknown values. `mcp_tool_phase` is exempt: the tool sets it on its own result, and tools must keep that value set small.

The high-cardinality **target** of a call (the datasource `uid`, else `name`) is never a metric label — it is span-only as `mcp.tool.target`, and empty for calls that name no entity (see below).

### Metric-name discovery

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mcp_metric_names_response_size_bytes` | Native histogram | Bytes consumed from complete successful discovery HTTP responses, after HTTP decompression |
| `mcp_metric_names_count` | Native histogram | Number of metric names decoded successfully before local filtering and pagination |

These metrics help us understand the responses we get from prometheus-type backends when discovering available metric names. The metrics only measure the sizes of successful responses. The bounded `backend` label distinguishes `prometheus` (including compatible backends) from `cloud_monitoring`. Unlike the prometheus backend, Cloud Monitoring measures the full descriptor response, which contain more than just names, so comparing response byte sizes between the two backends is not meaningful.

For example, the p95 response size over the last hour is:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (backend) (rate(mcp_metric_names_response_size_bytes[1h])))
```

These metrics use Native Histograms, so the scraper must also support native histograms.

### Loki cost guardrail metrics

When the [Loki query cost guardrail](../../configure/command-line-flags/) is enabled (`--loki-guardrail-mode` is `shadow` or `enforce`), every `query_loki_logs` call it evaluates increments exactly one of four counters:

| Metric | Type | Incremented when |
|--------|------|------------------|
| `mcp_loki_guardrail_admitted_total` | Counter | The query passed every enabled check |
| `mcp_loki_guardrail_would_block_total` | Counter | The query failed a check in `shadow` mode and ran anyway |
| `mcp_loki_guardrail_blocked_total` | Counter | The query failed a check in `enforce` mode and was rejected |
| `mcp_loki_guardrail_fail_open_total` | Counter | The guardrail could not reach a verdict and admitted the query |

The four partition the guarded population, so their sum is the number of calls the guardrail evaluated, and each is a query count rather than a check count.

**Labels:**

| Label | On | Values |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `reason` | `would_block`, `blocked` | `selector` (no selective label matcher), `range` (effective time range over the cap), `bytes` (index/stats estimate over the budget) |
| `cause` | `fail_open` | `unparseable` (no stream selector the scanner recognises), `estimate_failed` (index/stats unavailable) |
| `backend` | all four | `loki`, `victorialogs`, `unknown` |

A query can trip more than one check. It is counted **once**, labelled with the check that ran first — `selector`, then `range`, then `bytes`. That ordering is deliberate: the selectivity check is unconditional, so a query attributed to `selector` would not be admitted by raising `--loki-guardrail-max-range` or `--loki-guardrail-max-bytes`. When promoting from `shadow` to `enforce`, read `sum(rate(mcp_loki_guardrail_would_block_total[5m]))` for the size of the affected population and `sum by (reason) (...)` for whether tuning the bounds would shrink it.

Watch `mcp_loki_guardrail_fail_open_total` alongside them: a quiet `would_block` rate means "nothing would be blocked" only if the fail-open rate is also low. A high `cause="unparseable"` rate on `backend="loki"` means the guardrail's LogQL scanner does not recognise the query shapes in use, which calls for improving the scanner rather than tuning the bounds. On `backend="victorialogs"` a high `unparseable` rate is expected — brace-less LogsQL is the normal shape there, and the byte-budget check never runs on that backend at all, which is why `backend` is a label rather than being folded together.

Neither the stream selector nor the LogQL is exported as a label: both are unbounded, and line filters can carry sensitive literals. The extracted selectors are logged at `WARN` and the full query at `DEBUG` instead.

## Enable OpenTelemetry tracing

When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or the signal-specific `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`) is set, the server exports traces via OTLP/gRPC.

Local example:
```bash
# Send traces to a local Tempo instance
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true \
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http
```

Grafana Cloud example:

```bash
# Send traces to Grafana Cloud with authentication
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic ..." \
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http
```

Tool call spans follow naming like `tools/call <tool_name>` and include attributes such as `gen_ai.tool.name`, `mcp.method.name`, and `mcp.session.id`. The server supports W3C trace context propagation from the `_meta` field of tool call requests.

### Trace context propagation

Under an HTTP transport (SSE or streamable-http) the server takes part in [W3C trace context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) propagation on both sides, so a caller, mcp-grafana, and Grafana appear as one connected trace:

- **Inbound**: a `traceparent`/`tracestate` header on the incoming request (from an MCP client or an upstream proxy) parents the server span, continuing the caller's trace instead of starting a new one.
- **Outbound**: requests to the Grafana API carry a `traceparent` naming mcp-grafana's own span, so Grafana's spans hang off ours.

Propagation is always active — it does not require `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`. With trace export off, no spans are recorded but an inbound trace context is still passed through to Grafana rather than dropped.

The propagators used are configured with the standard [`OTEL_PROPAGATORS`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/general/#otel_propagators) environment variable, defaulting to `tracecontext,baggage`. Set it to interoperate with a non-W3C system (`b3`, `b3multi`, `jaeger`, `xray`, `ottrace`, in any comma-separated combination) or to `none` to disable propagation entirely.

Tool call requests may also carry `traceparent`/`tracestate` in their MCP `_meta` field; when present, that context parents the tool span. This is the only propagation channel available under stdio, where there is no HTTP request to read headers from.

Listing `traceparent` or `tracestate` in `GRAFANA_FORWARD_HEADERS` is not needed and no longer has an effect: forwarding the *caller's* `traceparent` verbatim would parent Grafana's spans onto the caller and cut mcp-grafana out of the middle of the trace, so a forwarded value never overrides the propagated one. Forwarded trace headers still apply when propagation is disabled with `OTEL_PROPAGATORS=none`.

Tool-call spans also carry the [tool-call dimensions](#tool-call-dimension-labels) `mcp.tool.operation`, `mcp.tool.resource_type`, and `mcp.tool.phase`, plus the span-only `mcp.tool.target` (the datasource `uid`, else `name`) for grouping the spans that touch one entity. `mcp.tool.target` is empty when a call names no entity — notably `create_datasource`'s `phase=schema` call, where the datasource does not exist yet — so stitching that call to the later `phase=created` one relies on the shared trace (when the client propagates context via `_meta`) or on `mcp.session.id` plus `mcp_tool_resource_type`, rather than on the target. Unlike the metric labels, these are attached for **all** tools with their **raw** values (no allowlist, no `other` bucket), since traces are high-cardinality by design. They require an **HTTP transport** (SSE or streamable-http, so a server span exists to enrich) **and tracing enabled**, but **not** `--metrics`; with stdio or tracing off, enrichment is a no-op.

## Enable OpenTelemetry logs

When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or the signal-specific `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`) is set, the server also exports structured logs via OTLP/gRPC in addition to the existing plain-text stderr output. Logs carry `trace_id` and `span_id` from the active span so they correlate with exported traces.

Traces and logs resolve their endpoints independently, so the two signals can be enabled separately:

- Setting only `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` enables tracing **without** log export.
- Setting only `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` enables log export without tracing.
- Setting the generic `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` enables both.

```bash
# Send logs and traces to a local OTel collector
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true \
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http
```

Stderr logging continues unchanged; operators can pipe stderr to `/dev/null` if they only want logs going to the OTel collector.

Logs can be sent directly to any managed backend that accepts OTLP/gRPC — for example, Grafana Cloud — by pointing `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` (or the generic `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) at the remote gRPC endpoint and supplying auth via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS` (or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`), mirroring the tracing example above. A local OTel collector is optional — useful for fan-out, batching, or multi-backend routing, but not required.

The signal-specific variants `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_INSECURE`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_CERTIFICATE`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_TIMEOUT`, and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_COMPRESSION` are honored and override their generic `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` counterparts — see the [OTel exporter spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/) for the full list and precedence rules.

**Note**: If the configured collector is unreachable, log records are buffered in memory (default queue: 2048) and the oldest records are dropped once the queue fills. The process continues without blocking the service. Configure a local OTel collector if you need lossless buffering during outages.

Logs are also exported under the stdio transport, which makes it easy to centralize logs from local `mcp-grafana` instances invoked by IDE clients.
