# Fleet version map

**This is the one place versions live.** Every other page and skill points here instead of hard-coding
a version. When the fleet moves (e.g. to 4.24), add a row and an `applies_to` token — nothing else changes.

## Versions in the fleet

| OCP minor | Kubernetes | HyperShift ref | MCE | CAPI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.16 | 1.29 | `release-4.16` | look up | look up | oldest in fleet |
| 4.20 | 1.33 | `release-4.20` | look up | look up | |
| 4.22 | 1.35 | `release-4.22` | look up | look up | newest in fleet; matches pinned `docs/upstream/kubernetes` |

"look up" = not recorded yet; don't guess. Find it, then fill the cell (bump `last_verified`):

- MCE for a hub: `oc get multiclusterengine -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.currentVersion}'`
- CAPI vendored in a HyperShift branch: `search_code repo=hypershift ref=release-4.NN path="go.mod" pattern="sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api "`
- Kubernetes for a cluster: `oc version` (Server Version → Kubernetes Version)

## How to pick a ref (applies to every `git_repo` source)

1. Identify the cluster's OCP minor, then use this table.
2. `list_refs` with a filter to confirm the ref exists in the mirror (`release-4.22`, `v1.9`).
3. Pass `ref` on `search`, `search_code`, `find_definition`, `read_code`. Never rely on `main` for a
   specific cluster — it describes the future.
4. For add-ons that are **not** versioned with OCP (AKO, KServe/RHOAI, Portworx, GPU operator, Gateway API CRDs,
   vLLM image), read the installed version from the cluster and use the matching tag. See
   `knowledge/meta/doc-sources-catalog.md` for where each one's version comes from.

## Kubernetes docs mirror is 1.35 only

`docs/upstream/kubernetes` is a single mirror at the newest fleet version. For 4.16 (1.29) and 4.20 (1.33)
clusters, a feature described there may be alpha/beta, behind a feature gate, or absent. Check the page's
"feature state" banner against the table above before advising a change.

## Writing version-generic pages

- State ranges, not "current": "since 4.18", "up to 4.20", "all fleet versions".
- Put the same range in `applies_to` (`ocp-4.16`, `ocp-4.20`, …). `[]` means genuinely version-independent.
- If behaviour differs per version, use a small table in the page, not separate pages.

## History

- 2026-10-03: created (fleet = 4.16 / 4.20 / 4.22; Kubernetes mapping as stated by the platform team).
